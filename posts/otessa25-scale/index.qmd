## Developing the Technology-integrated Assessment Scale

## Acknowledgements

Our team is spread across most of the country and we each live and work on land that has been cared for by Indigenous people for millenia. We each acknowledge that our abundant lives were made possible because of the displacement of the original stewards of the land.

# Draft Questions

## Part B: Scenario-Based Questions {.unnumbered}

You will be presented with five scenarios in this section. Each scenario has 15 actions. For each action, please identify how likely you are to do each of the following as part of your overall response to the scenario (1=highly unlikely; 2=unlikely; 3=somewhat unlikely; 4=somewhat likely; 5=likely; 6=highly likely).

Please interpret the scenario in relation to your current teaching context; if you teach across contexts, select one context and keep this context in mind when completing the entire survey. There are no right or wrong answers. We are interested in your honest responses to the scenarios. If you do not understand the statement, select 'Don't Know.'

29. Below are a number of statements about assessment. Please indicate your level of agreement with each statement (1=strongly disagree; 2=disagree; 3=somewhat disagree; 4=somewhat agree; 5=agree; 6=strongly agree). There are no right or wrong answers. We are interested in your honest opinions about assessment. If you do not understand the statement, select 'Don't Know.'
