  abstract = {Language assessment literacy forms the knowledge base needed to conduct language assessment procedures, that is, to design, administer, interpret, utilize, and report language assessment data for different purposes. The term is derived from the generic assessment literacy concept which refers to the knowledge and skills required for performing assessment-related actions (Stiggins, 1991; Webb, 2002). Language assessment literacy encompasses not only familiarity with tools and procedures for evaluating students' language abilities, but additional components, particularly the ability to render apt feedback so as to effectively direct learners toward setting and reaching future learning targets. Furthermore, assessment literate professionals are also aware of the ethical aspects involved in the assessment process and of the possible ramifications of putting assessment-based decisions into practice, hence consequential validity (Messick, 1989).

It specifically attempts to investigate the extent to which two assessment courses may facilitate and/or inhibit the development of pre-service teachers' language assessment literacy in one teacher education institution. Findings indicate that language assessment training in Hong Kong remains inadequate and selected language assessment courses are still unable to bridge the theory-practice gap within the assessment reform context. Implications and recommendations for promoting language assessment literacy are discussed.}

For instance, foreign language (FL) teachers have to deal with standardised tests as well as their own classroom-based assessment procedures. This means they need the necessary expertise that can be provided by training measures. To gauge the current level of FL teachers in LTA literacy and identify their training needs in this area, data from seven European countries were collected in a mixed-methods study that used questionnaires (n = 853) and qualitative data from teacher interviews (n = 63) in selected countries across Europe. Despite the small differences across countries, the results show that only certain elements of teachers' LTA expertise are developed. To compensate for insufficient training, teachers seem to learn about LTA on the job or use teaching materials for their assessment purposes. Teachers overall express a need to receive training across the range of LTA features identified in the study with varying priorities, depending on their local educational contexts.}

This article describes a research project in which a survey instrument was developed, piloted, and delivered on the Internet to elicit the assessment training needs of language teachers. The results were used to inform the design of new teaching materials and the further development of online resources that could be used to support program delivery. The project makes two significant contributions. First, it provides new empirically derived content for the concept of assessment literacy within which to frame materials development and teaching. Second, it uncovered methodological problems with existing survey techniques that may have impacted upon earlier studies, and solutions to these problems are suggested.}

While the AL of university English teachers in China is particularly crucial as they teach the largest group of adult English language learners in the world, it has regrettably remained largely unexplored. The present study subjected an adapted version of the Teacher Assessment Literacy Questionnaire to rigorous psychometric property analyses, and used it to investigate the AL level of Chinese university English teachers (N=891) and the effects of their demographic characteristics on AL performance. Findings reveal a basic level of AL in certain dimensions with limited influence from demographic characteristics. Discussions are centered around validation of the AL instrument, causes for limited AL competence, and key factors that have impacted AL. This study concludes with a reflection of constructing contextually-grounded AL measures and implications for principles, policy and practice of teacher assessment education.},

  abstract = {Abstract Teachers require specialised assessment knowledge and skills in order to effectively assess student learning. These knowledge and skills develop over time through ongoing teacher learning and experiences. The first part of this paper presents a Summative Assessment Literacy Rubric (SALRubric) constructed to track the development of secondary science teachers' summative assessment literacy. The analytic rubric consists of 10 dimensions spread across three categories drawn from the literature and context-specific empirical evidence: knowledge of assessment, understanding the context for assessment, and recognising the impact of assessment. The second part of this paper applies the SALRubric in a case study to explore the development of summative assessment literacy of New Zealand secondary science pre-service and novice teachers. An increasing sophistication in these teachers' summative assessment literacy was evident over 20 months albeit in a nuanced manner for individual teachers. The rubric was a very useful tool for evaluating and documenting shifts in teachers' summative assessment literacy over time. Implications of the use of SALRubric are discussed in terms of summative assessment literacy practice and development.}

More than two decades ago, US assessment scholar Rick Stiggins sounded an alarm about teachers' inabilities to conduct effective language assessment; he wrote: ``we are a nation of assessment illiterates'' (Stiggins 1991, p. 535). In the same decade, the UK assessment for learning reform (Black and Wiliam 1998) also triggered considerable interest in teacher assessment literacy. Since then, there has been an increasing realization throughout the world that teacher assessment literacy is underdeveloped (Jin 2010; Popham 2011; Volante and Fazio 2007) and that it warrants urgent attention on teachers' professional development programs.}

However, despite these policies and standards, research has shown that beginning teachers continue to maintain low competency levels in assessment. Limited assessment education that is potentially misaligned to assessment standards and classroom practices has been identified as one factor contributing to a lack of assessment competency. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to analyze the alignment between teacher education accreditation policies, professional standards for teacher assessment practice, and preservice assessment course curriculum. Through a curriculum alignment methodology involving two policy documents, two professional standards documents, and syllabi from 10 Florida-based, Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education--certified teacher education programs, the results of this study serve to identify points of alignment and misalignment across policies, standards, and curricula. The study concludes with a discussion on the current state of assessment education with implications for enhancing teacher preparation in this area and future research on assessment education.}

In this exploratory research, we report on a group wiki project in an engineering management unit at an Australian university. A wiki was introduced to replace the existing group report assessment to add transparency to the task. Each group had their own wiki and students were required to provide feedback to other group wikis which enabled transparency of students' report development and group progress. The research aim was to investigate student perceptions of using a wiki. Students found the wikis helpful for benchmarking their activity against their peers. Students stated that peer feedback had improved their work; however, much of the feedback given by peers was too brief to be constructive, and provided too late to be useful in guiding their work. This paper will be of interest to academics interested in using wikis in their teaching to develop feedback, transparency, and benchmarking.},

Virtual University of Pakistan (VU), an online university, offers pre-service teacher education programs. This research is an investigation into the learning opportunities and practices of VU student teachers in their teaching practice modules. Students enrolled in different teacher education programs served as the population of this study. Those in the fall 2018 semester who were enrolled in teaching practice modules were selected as a sample. Data sources included lesson plans prepared, lessons delivered, administrative and co-curricular duties performed by the students, as well as evaluation reports by supervisors, cooperating teachers, and school principals. There were improvements in the student teachers' lesson plan formation and their overall learning. Data obtained through personal visits by VU faculty was used to verify and assess actual classroom teaching. Lack of regular attendance and punctuality by student teachers was observed as a result. Internal review of the VU system as it relates to the teaching practice modules was conducted to address any shortcomings in the course(s), its procedures, and its controls. Recommendations for improving the system, such as grading the modules, peer-assessment, and orientation workshops for student teachers are provided, as well as suggestions for developments in the teaching practice modules themselves.},

A classroom assessment tool was administered weekly to students in an introductory level animal science laboratory course. Of the six laboratory sections (n = 27 per lab section), three sections were randomly selected to complete assessments at the conclusion of each laboratory period. Based on the assessment responses, feedback was provided at the beginning of the next week's laboratory period to clarify material that students had expressed difficulty understanding. Data were collected on student perception of classroom engagement, communication, and learning abilities through a Likert scale survey administered at the end of the semester. Final exam grades and survey responses from students (n = 161) enrolled in this class were compared to evaluate the effect of assessments on student grades and student's perception of learning. Final exam grades were compared between treatment and control groups using a Students t-test and Likert scale survey questions using a Chi-Squared test. Surveys administered to the lab sections that participated in the assessment activity included additional questions to evaluate assessment effectiveness. No differences (P {$>$} 0.05) between groups were observed for final exam grades or student's confidence of their ability for short or long-term retention of the material. Weekly feedback provided to students based on assessment responses had a greater impact on perceived learning ability (P = 0.014) and classroom engagement (P = 0.01) than completing the assessment without this feedback. Utilizing assessment techniques to provide directed feedback may positively impact student engagement and learning in the classroom, although enhanced perceived learning was not associated with final exam grades.},

Students peer reviewed presentations and two external raters evaluated the presentations based on a rubric adapted from Savory ( 2009 ). Students reviewed activity using two assessment instruments: a seven-point attitudinal scale and a 1--5 ranking scale. The study utilized a mixed-methods, embedded QUAN:qual design, where statistical analysis of Pearson Correlation coefficient was paired with qualitative description to discuss the data gathered. The findings showed that students' scores on the attitudinal scale and their holistic rankings correlated positively with the degree of technology employed in the presentations. The greater the integration of technology in a presentation, the higher the peer rating. However, the external raters' evaluations did not generally accord with the student-raters'.},

Since there is limited guidance available for their use in a university setting, our goal is to learn what are the important aspects in student acceptance of e-assessments that support learning of mathematical subjects in higher education. To that end we analyse the effects of a variety of attitudinal factors towards such assessments amongst a cross-section of first year students in an English university, using a detailed questionnaire. These students were all previously exposed to on-line assessments containing substantial mathematical work, including testing of and feedback on the algebraic structure of their answers, based on identifiable misconceptions underlying these answers. Since students received highly tailored feedback, the expectation was that the usefulness of this feedback would be the key driver in their usage of educational technology. The results indeed suggest that students find on-line feedback more enjoyable and useful than conventional feedback, but enjoyment and attitude are the two most important factors.},

However, little has been done to understand the academic integrity implications in alternative online and non-invigilated assessments. Aim This study explored the perceptions of higher education students regarding academic integrity in alternative assessments. Methods Cross-sectional mixed method design following the parallel convergent approach was utilised in this study. A convenience sample of 380 undergraduate and postgraduate nursing and social science students completed an online survey on academic integrity behaviours associated with alternative assessments. Results High risk (31.7\%) of academic misconduct was perceived among young people (18-24\,years old). Collusion was common among nursing students (24.5\%) and cheating likely to occur in assessments with longer duration---between 2 and 4\,hours (18.8\%) and between 1 and 2\,weeks (46\%). Qualitative data resulted in 274 findings and three themes--- (i) impossible to cheat; (ii) easy to cheat and (iii) understanding the consequence of cheating. Suggestions for preserving academic integrity in alternative assessments were also made from the qualitative data. Conclusion Like other forms of traditional assessments, alternative assessments have increased risk of breach of academic integrity; however, with the right strategies, they could serve as effective means of assessing learning outcomes.},

Online exams are effective in either blended or traditional forms of learning, and, when appropriately used, bring benefits to both learners and the learning process. However, learners' perceptions of online exams in developing countries have not been widely studied despite the potential of such research for contributing to more effective use of online exams in these countries. Thus, this study served two purposes. First, it aimed to investigate students' perceptions of online exams at a state university in Turkey, and at a state university in Kyrgyzstan. Second, the study compared the results. Structured as a mixed study, the research was conducted during the 2018-2019 fall term. The participants were 370 undergraduate students taking first-year courses online. Quantitative data considered learners' perception scores gathered via a survey, whereas qualitative data considered learners' opinions in response to an open-ended question. According to the quantitative analysis, learners' perceptions differed according to gender, major, and prior online course experience variables. In addition, Turkish and Kyrgyz learners differed in that Turkish learners found online exams less stressful and more reliable and fairer than traditional paper-based exams when compared with their Kyrgyz counterparts. The qualitative analysis provided important results for future planning in both institutions.},

The purpose of the study was to investigate their perceptions on the issues relating to assessment practices. A survey research design was used for the study. A close- ended questionnaire, with four point Likert scale was developed regarding the issues on assessment practices and administered to a randomly selected five hundred (500) undergraduates from five (5) randomly selected tertiary institutions of higher Education in Botswana. Out of which four hundred and thirty six (436) undergraduate tertiary students responded to the questionnaire and their responses were coded, analysed using descriptive statistics (frequency distributions, mean, standard deviation of responses), exploratory factor analysis, independent t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results revealed eight (8) main issues of assessment practices as perceived by Botswana Private Tertiary undergraduate students which were as follows: Limited assessment strategies used by lecturers; Inadequate feedback; Non-challenging quality of test items; Assessment to be structured for teaching and learning; Assessment by lecturers not fair and valid; Assessment items focuses more on low order cognitive questions; Timing of assessments not strategic; Marking of assessments by lecturers not consistent. The study further determined if gender and the different tertiary institutions had a significant influence on the undergraduate students' perceived issues on assessment practices at the different private tertiary universities. It was found that that gender and university of study had significant influence on students' perceptions with regard to some issues on assessment practices. Based on the findings, all these issues perceived by the undergraduate students would inform institutions of higher education in Botswana tertiary institutions.

More alarmingly, numerous studies have pointed to increasing rates of cheating and plagiarism over the past few decades offering a wide array of explanations and theories for this trend. A relatively new feature of both higher education and the discussion of academic dishonesty involves the growing market for online education. Within the last decade, online education has become a permanent fixture increasing its reach in education markets throughout the world. The trend of online education is seen as bringing with it a new set of opportunities and challenges related to academic dishonesty. With high rates of cheating already a well-documented problem in the traditional (face-to-face) learning environment, it is important to analyze how online education factors into this scenario. The goal of this paper is to provide the reader with a critical analysis of the current literature on academic dishonesty in online education and to propose areas for future research where gaps in the literature exist.},

Likewise, individualized tutoring has helped pre-service candidates improve instructional practice and peer debriefing has been found to help push their thinking. However, questions remain regarding the usefulness of these techniques to develop candidates' assessment literacy. The primary aim of this exploratory qualitative study was to describe pre-service teachers' perceptions of assessment literacy and the process of their assessment literacy development during a literacy assessment class containing an individualized tutoring component. Five teacher candidates in a literacy assessment and instruction course at a large urban university in the US engaged in individual semi-structured interviews and submitted written reflections and artifacts which were analyzed following the constant comparative and content analysis methods. Findings were that individualized tutoring allowed participants to apply the assessment techniques they were learning in class to determine their suitability with the diverse urban learners. Likewise, peer debriefing enabled them to share knowledge and ideas, offer mutual support and engage in collaborative problem solving to improve their tutoring. These findings support the conclusion that individualized tutoring and peer debriefing within a graduate class can be effective tools for deepening candidates' reflection, connecting theory to practice, and providing feedback on instructional technique to support their assessment literacy development.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has been a major concern across the globe affecting nation's socio-economic development including education. It has pushes many HEIs in world to move into remote learning as a substitute of in-person instruction. The study explored students' response to online learning in higher education in Ghana. The study was guided by three research questions. Descriptive survey design was adopted and online questionnaire was used to gather data from 467 students in a higher education of Ghana. The data was analysed using frequency and percentage. Overall, the study found that students had positive response to online learning. They knew of online learning and some of the platforms like UCC Moodle platform, Alison and Google classroom. They would also like to use other social media platforms. They would use smart phone and laptop for the online learning. However, they were not ready for online learning because they lacked formal orientation and training, perceived lack of constant access to internet connectivity and financial unpreparedness. Management of the university should provide resources to help students assess whether they are ready to take an online course and offer suggestions for preparation. Since internet accessibility is expensive in Ghana at the moment, management of the university should hold negotiations with Cellular operators for educational discount for distance students. Academic staff should provide instructional support through instructional activities that can help students in appraising their readiness, gaining the needed skills to learn online and consider using flexible approaches to teaching and deadlines to accommodate students with reliable Wi-Fi or broadband access challenges as well as emotional response to help student ensure smooth transition to emergency remote learning/teaching.},

The purpose of this study is to explore how from lecturers to department heads to understand and proficiency in digitizing student assessment in the 4.0 era. This study uses the SDLC waterfall method in building gamificationbased smart assessment. Researchers need to explore how to understand the concept of skills towards digitizing student assessments required to produce an effective and efficient system. The findings show that lecturers are able to see digitalization with broad and complex concepts including the pedagogical, technical, administrative and academic structures of the University. The role of the lecturer seems to play an essential and complex role due to digitization so that it impacts on the level of student motivation. However, time, human resources, as well as professional development, continue to influence in supporting the learning process of lecturers and students. This paper contributes to the digitization and quality of lecturers' smart assessment of students. The contribution shown for lecturers is trying to implement and be able to digitize in 4.0 era as a form of transformation in the field of education. The application of smart assessment helps the quality of lecturers' quality of input scores in students effectively and accurately so that it impacts on students knowing the value in real-time and becomes motivated by gamification.},

As part of imparting quality higher education for undergraduate and post graduate students, Srinivas Institute of Management Studies (SIMS) developed an education service model for integrated academic support. Backed by the presumption that evaluation is the essence of examination and examination is vital to assessment, the college has instituted a wide range of evaluation processes which runs parallel to curriculum delivery. In this paper, we have analysed the strategies followed by Srinivas Institute of Management Studies, which is affiliated to Mangalore University for ensuring transparency in evaluation and undertaking reforms to strengthen it. The paper discusses details on the major evaluation reforms of the university that the institution has adopted, and the reforms initiated by the institution on its own, details on some of the formative and summative evaluation approaches adopted to measure student achievement which have positively impacted the system, details on the significant improvements made in ensuring rigor and transparency in the internal assessment and weightages assigned, for the overall development of students. The graduate attributes specified by the college/affiliating university and the institutional effort to ensure the attainment of these by the students, and details of the mechanisms for redressal of grievances with reference to evaluation both at the college and University level are also analysed.},

  abstract = {This paper offers a critical and theoretical exploration of the contemporary use of standards in assessment in higher education. It outlines three discourses of assessment standards. Each perspective foregrounds particular realities and backgrounds others, and so influences practice in particular taken-for-granted ways. The assumptions of these perspectives are identified, and the advantages and disadvantages of each of the existing discourses discussed. The dominant perspective prompts educators to make standards `transparent' for students, inferring stability through a written explication. The sociocultural perspective highlights a tacit and more dynamic view of standards, suggesting that standards are built by expert consensus and students must learn to meet this community expectation. The sociomaterial perspective also infers a dynamic view, but one that is co-produced through social and material assemblages. Thinking about standards as performance, a dynamic and shifting human-material activity, encourages a focus on emergent activity in the design of standards, moderation and assessment.

Although recent studies have examined approaches to foster EFL learners' critical thinking, studies conducted in online settings are under-development. The participants were 31 Japanese undergraduate students enrolled in an online EFL course; their degree of critical thinking and resistance towards critical thinking were examined. First, the students' sense of classroom community was measured using the Rovai's Classroom Community Scale. Second, the frequency of using critical thinking in their English writing was observed adopting with Stapleton's rubric, and the resistance towards learning critical thinking was measured through a questionnaire. The results indicated that students could feel a sense of classroom community in online lessons as well as face-to-face settings, and improvements in critical thinking were found in students' writing regardless of the differences in their English proficiency level. A resistance towards tackling questions that required higher-order thinking was observed among low English proficiency level students compared to a face-to-face classroom setting. This study suggests that an online EFL course aiming to promote critical thinking reduce students' resistance offering both informal and formal interactive opportunities to answer questions involving higher-order thinking skills.},

A sequential triangulation research design, using mix-method approaches, has been used for this research. All distance education students studying in B.Ed. and M.Ed. programs at Allama Iqbal Open University, Islamabad make the target population of the study. Through random sampling techniques, a sample of 344 prospective teachers and 18 teacher educators constitute the sample group. Results indicate that the study material satisfied the standards as stipulated in the National Professional Standards for Teachers in Pakistan; however, the assessment literacy of prospective teachers was found unsatisfactory. Furthermore, it was revealed that students' low motivation, low interaction between tutors and prospective teachers, and traditional approaches and beliefs were found to be the areas requiring urgent attention with regard to reforms in assessment. The presentation of study materials is found to be less engaging with no clearly specified road map for implementation in classrooms. Assessment practices by teacher educators included only summative approaches. Therefore, it is recommended that the study materials may be re-designed to ensure that it leads towards prospective teachers' assessment literacy.},

The research was carried out with 3rd and 4th-degree university students who study in coaching education programs in Turkey. Students consist of 221 male (\%68,4) and 102 female (\%31,6). Furthermore, 12 volunteer students were interviewed as part of the qualitative part of the research. Results indicate that there is a positive significant relationship between conflict-handling styles and negotiations style only among integrating style and avoiding style. On the other hand, there is no significant relationship between the dominating, compromising, obliging styles of conflict handling and the dominating, compromising, and obliging styles of negotiation, respectively. Interviews with students revealed that negotiations in ENACT game-based assessment are very close to their real-life experience. Besides, it can be stated that discussing the aspects of the student's views on the goal achievement effort, relationship, and social skills according to the framework of the social interdependence can make significant contributions to further improvement of the ENACT game-based assessment tool.},

Applying mixed methodology for the research design, the study used transcript analysis, learning outcomes, perceived learning, satisfaction, and interviews to assess learning processes and outcomes. The findings for learning processes and outcomes indicated that students in both online and blended courses were able to reach high levels of cognitive presence and learning outcomes. The results suggest that cognitive presence in a community of inquiry is associated with perceived and actual learning outcomes. It is recommended that future research efforts focus on quantitative measures to establish links between cognitive presence and the quality of learning outcomes.}

Results revealed that participants' postings reflected the critical thinking indicators proposed by Newman like relevance and importance, but students need to enhance skills like justification, and critical assessment. According to Garrisons' model, participants could identify, and explore problems, but they need support to evaluate the problem and integrate solutions into their existing knowledge. The findings reveal that participants acquire essential critical thinking skills, but they need to focus on higher order skills. Further research should be conducted using different courses issues to impart the critical thinking indicators that students need in higher institutions. In addition, instructors should be trained on how to formulate online tasks that stimulate high level of thinking.},

This research presents evidence of the ways in which the social and human practices of online exams are deeply entangled with the material and technological, and cautions against the reinscribing of essentialist or instrumentalist assumptions about technology in assessment practices. Through semi-structured interviews with eight practitioners in Norway, the Netherlands, the UK and Ireland, it analyses the impact, dimensions and limitations of two main discourses: "migration," whereby exam technologies are assumed to be neutral instruments used independently by humans to realise their preordained intentions; and "transformation," whereby the essential and inalienable qualities of technologies can be released to 'transform' or 'enhance' assessment. Its findings indicate that: (1) exam technologies are neither inherently neutral nor essentially transformational; (2) implementation projects underpinned by the migration discourse can be much more complex and resource-intensive than anticipated; and (3) 'transformative' change may be value-laden and driven by assumptions. Given the complex and entangled nature of online exams, practitioners are encouraged to think creatively about how assessment strategies align with educational goals, to consider the limitations of current discourses and to analyse critically the relational and performative roles of digital technologies.},

The results showed that the most highly endorsed practices included giving feedback, linking assessments to learning objectives and learning outcomes, using scoring guides, and monitoring and revising assessment approaches. The least endorsed practices included mapping summative assessment to curriculum expectations, responding to the cultural and linguistic diversity of students, and accommodating students with special needs/exceptionalities in assessments. Further, during the pandemic, formative assessments were rarely used. Although faculty members from various colleges and fields of specialty showed similar patterns in endorsing assessment practices, they differed in their preferences and needs for assessment education.},

The forceful transition from face-to-face to online assessments, as part of the emergency implementation of online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has affected teaching, learning, and assessment experiences worldwide. This study explores how faculty members in Saudi universities secured their online assessment during phase one of the COVID-19 pandemic. The research aims were: 1) identifying faculty assessment practices before the onset of COVID-19 and comparing these with practices during the pandemic, and 2) identifying the major challenges faced by the faculty members of the study in securing their online assessment to ensure that academic integrity and assessment standards remained intact. Data were collected from seven university professors through a self-reporting survey, followed by semi-structured interviews. The faculty members found the pandemic period to be the best time to change their assessment methods, and incorporate innovative ideas that conformed to both their own beliefs and students' needs. The factors that influenced the faculty's assessment alterations were their personal beliefs and learnings from others' experiences, in addition to the guidelines issued by Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Education. The results of this study have implications for the development of post-COVID-19 assessment practices and professional development priorities.},

  abstract = {Evaluating written texts is believed to be a time-consuming process that can lack consistency and objectivity. Automated essay scoring (AES) can provide solutions to some of the limitations of human scoring. This research aimed to evaluate the performance of one AES system, Grammarly, in comparison to human raters. Both approaches' performances were analyzed quantitatively using Corder's (1974) error analysis approach to categorize the writing errors in a corpus of 197 essays written by English as a foreign language (EFL) learners. Pearson correlation coefficient and paired sample t-tests were conducted to analyze and compare errors detected by both approaches. According to the study's results, a moderate correlation between human raters and AES in terms of the total scores and the number of errors detected. Results also indicated that the total number of errors detected by AES is significantly higher than human raters and that the latter tend to give students higher scores. The findings encourage a more open attitude towards AES systems to support EFL writing teachers in assessing students' work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Forming and evaluating in a competency-based approach involves challenges for the teaching staff and changes in their role that are accepted or resisted. The same happens in the face of innovation processes with information and communication technologies (ICT) integration in teaching practices. The primary results show a relationship between pedagogical beliefs and evaluation which is consistent with adoption and assessment of the digital tool used. In addition, it reveals the role of beliefs as secondary barriers to change in the face of teaching practices with the use of technology (Ertmer, Ottenbreit-Leftwich, Sadik, Sendurur, \& Sendurur, 2012). This study identifies the value of autonomy in student work and feedback as key beliefs in technology adoption.},

  abstract = {Both paper-based and computerized exams have a high level of cheating. It is, therefore, desirable to be able to detect cheating accurately. Keeping the academic integrity of student evaluations intact is one of the biggest issues in online education. There is a substantial possibility of academic dishonesty during final exams since teachers are not directly monitoring students. We suggest a novel method in this study for identifying possible exam-cheating incidents using Machine Learning (ML) approaches. The 7WiseUp behavior dataset compiles data from surveys, sensor data, and institutional records to improve student well-being and academic performance. It offers information on academic achievement, student attendance, and behavior in general. In order to build models for predicting academic accomplishment, identifying at-risk students, and detecting problematic behavior, the dataset is designed for use in research on student behavior and performance. Our model approach surpassed all prior three-reference efforts with an accuracy of 90\% and used a long short-term memory (LSTM) technique with a dropout layer, dense layers, and an optimizer called Adam. Implementing a more intricate and optimized architecture and hyperparameters is credited with increased accuracy. In addition, the increased accuracy could have been caused by how we cleaned and prepared our data. More investigation and analysis are required to determine the precise elements that led to our model's superior performance.},

  abstract = {Student performance is crucial to the success of tertiary institutions. Especially, academic achievement is one of the metrics used in rating top-quality universities. Despite the large volume of educational data, accurately predicting student performance becomes more challenging. The main reason for this is the limited research in various machine learning (ML) approaches. Accordingly, educators need to explore effective tools for modelling and assessing student performance while recognizing weaknesses to improve educational outcomes. The existing ML approaches and key features for predicting student performance were investigated in this work. Related studies published between 2015 and 2021 were identified through a systematic search of various online databases. Thirty-nine studies were selected and evaluated. The results showed that six ML models were mainly used: decision tree (DT), artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), linear regression (LinR), and Naive Bayes (NB). Our results also indicated that ANN outperformed other models and had higher accuracy levels. Furthermore, academic, demographic, internal assessment, and family/personal attributes were the most predominant input variables (e.g., predictive features) used for predicting student performance. Our analysis revealed an increasing number of research in this domain and a broad range of ML algorithms applied. At the same time, the extant body of evidence suggested that ML can be beneficial in identifying and improving various academic performance areas.},

The outcome-based evaluation of this paper is intended to provide lessons for any future situations of this significance and magnitude. While online education was the obvious response to the pandemic, the provision of assessments was not possible without risk. Taking a high-stakes decision that would affect the future of thousands of students, for years to come, involved complex steps of reasoning and justification. Addressing the role of graded assessment in supporting institutional accountability and transferability of students' achievements, student efficacy and informed pedagogy alterations were the main objectives. To meet those objectives, the Higher Colleges of Technology was able to deploy an off-campus student assessment model that builds upon three pillars of adjustments (assessment development and deployment; technology infrastructure; and governance resilience) to support students' learning, while mitigating vulnerabilities. The evaluation of student performance indicators and stakeholders' satisfaction rates revealed a successful deployment of off-campus assessment while maintaining the traditional conventions pertaining to evaluation of assessments.},

The collected data were analyzed using a constant comparative analysis method. The results revealed that multiple proactive supports (i.e., social, pedagogical, and technical support) play critical roles in fostering meaningful collaboration. Instructor presence is an essential factor that enables collaboration to occur as desired through setting the stage, modeling desired expectations, and guiding students to reach expected outcomes. Assessments also have an impact on students' level of engagement; therefore, incorporating both formative and summative assessments for both the product and the process of collaboration is recommended.

  abstract = {Conscientiousness-related personality traits are relevant predictors of many outcomes in achievement domains outside sport. They have also been associated with several outcomes in sport, however, their relative role on athletes' deliberate practice (DP) and other criteria of expertise development has not been investigated. The overall aim of this dissertation was to examine the role of conscientiousness-related traits on sport expertise development. It had six specific purposes: (a) to examine the structural validity of conscientiousness-related measures; (b) to understand whether athletes' DP amounts, skill level, and other criteria of expertise development could be predicted by these measures; (c) to identify the best personality predictor and combination of predictors that explained the maximal variance in different criteria of expertise development; (d) to examine whether grit facets predicted athletes' practice engagement across a demanding sport season; (e) to explore coaches' perspectives on the behavioural indicators of conscientious, gritty, and self-controlled athletes in training; and (f) to explore coaches' views about how these personality traits may impact athletes' quantity and quality of practice and development toward higher skill levels. The dissertation used a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design, wherein Phase 1 (Articles 1, 2, and 3) quantitatively pursued purposes (a) to (c), Phase 2 (Article 4) addressed (d), and Phase 3 (Article 5) qualitatively addressed (e) and (f). Article 1 tested the factor structure of the Brief Self-Control Scale in sport and showed distinct associations between self-control variables and (a) sport-specific practice amounts, (b) engagement in various practice contexts, and (c) threats to commitment to one's sport, in a diverse sport sample. Article 2 conducted factor analyses of the Grit Scale in sport and examined a full latent variable model showing associations between grit variables and several criteria of expertise development. In particular, perseverance of effort associated with athletes' weekly amounts of DP, engagement in different practice contexts, and skill level, while consistency of interests associated with athletes' commitment to their sport. Article 3 comprised two studies. In Study 1, path analyses were used to assess the role of conscientiousness on criteria of expertise development. At the broad level, conscientiousness predicted athletes' engagement in practice contexts and commitment to their sport; at the facet-level, achievement-striving was the best predictor of athletes' weekly DP and engagement in practice contexts. The systematic test of the role of self-control (Article 1), grit (Article 2), and conscientiousness (Article 3, Study1) for key criteria of expertise development culminated with Study 2 of Article 3, which reported comparative analyses of the predictive ability of self-control, grit, and conscientiousness facets---which had shown to be significant predictors when assessed separately---for the criterion measures of sport expertise. Study 2 showed that (a) perseverance of effort was the best predictor of athletes' weekly DP, engagement in mandatory practice, and the only predictor of higher skill level, (b) achievement-striving best predicted athletes' engagement in optional practice, and (c) consistency of interests best predicted athletes' commitment to their sport. Article 4 tested whether athletes' self-reported levels of grit (broad and facets) were longitudinally associated with their coach-reported practice engagement throughout one sport season. Perseverance of effort was the grit variable most related to indicators of practice engagement, the only variable related to overall practice engagement across three time points, and the only variable marginally associated with athletes' stability of practice engagement over time. Article 5 explored coaches' views about the behavioural indicators of athletes' conscientiousness, grit, and self-control in the daily training environment and how these traits impacted athletes' training and development. Coaches described (a) conscientious athletes as systematic and detail-oriented, highly considerate of others, and highly engaged in self-regulation; (b) gritty athletes as those who persevere despite adversity and work hard in practice; and (c) self-controlled athletes as those who control impulses, resist temptations, and delay gratification. Coaches believe grit, conscientiousness, and self-control play important roles on athletes' development toward higher skill levels, but results generally highlighted the preponderance of perseverance of effort. Potential mechanisms (e.g., conscientiousness---self-regulation---practice quality and conscientiousness---self-regulation---skill level) were highlighted to help explain the personality-expertise link found in Phases 1 and 2. This dissertation contributed to the literature on sport expertise by parsimoniously identifying conscientiousness-related personality traits that were associated with measures of athletes' practice quantity, quality, and stability, commitment to sport, and higher skill level. Although several facets (i.e., perseverance of effort, consistency of interests, achievement-striving, self-discipline, and dutifulness) showed associations with practice and performance-related outcomes, this dissertation generally highlighted the role of grit facets. In particular, while perseverance of effort was the best predictor of athletes' amounts of DP, the only grit variable associated with quality practice engagement over time, and the only predictor of higher skill level, consistency of interests was the best predictor of commitment variables. Furthermore, results based on coaches' descriptions (a) provided behavioural indicators of conscientiousness-related traits that serve as reference points for practitioners aiming to help athletes develop desirable traits, (b) suggested that gritty athletes `work hard' and conscientious athletes `work smart', and (c) proposed mechanisms to explain the personality-expertise link found in the quantitative studies. Taken together, the results of this dissertation suggest that the tendency to persevere despite adversity and mindfully use self-regulated processes seems to be a powerful predisposition for athletes' development toward expert levels of performance.},

It identifies teachers' and students' responses about the ongoing issues with E-teaching of ESP with to put practical solutions to them. The study is conducted at The University Center for Girls' Studies- Al-Samir Campus-Abha during the academic year 2020-2021. Twenty English Language instructors at the English Language Center (ELC) and eighty students of the preparatory year at the College of Medicine enrolled in Intensive English Course (Njl-019) participated in the study. It adopts mixed qualitative methodology with the teachers' semi-structured interview and students' questionnaire as tools to collect data, and descriptive analysis as a method to interpret data. The study finds out reciprocity of teachers' and students' responses in pinpointing the factors posing serious challenges in teaching and learning ESP courses as majorly related to technology, pedagogy, and Assessment. Considering these challenges, the study puts forth practical suggestions to promote virtual teaching and learning of ESP courses. The suggested solutions are hoped to help providing successful standards for virtual ESP teaching and learning as per the constraints of quality modern education.},

  abstract = {Universities are increasingly leveraging virtual teams into their organizational structure and strategic framework for many functions including academic administration and faculty leadership. One benefit of a virtual workforce is the ability to hire the most qualified individuals regardless of where they are physically located. As the virtual workforce expands, leaders may intuitively rely on traditional face-to-face approaches and strategies for employee oversight and motivation. These techniques may be ineffective or challenging to use in the virtual environment necessitating new approaches. Leaders of virtual teams need to understand the intricacies associated with these groups and be cognizant of factors that assist in creating cohesiveness, trust, and communication amongst virtual teams. This qualitative phenomenological study explores leaders' perceptions surrounding competencies needed to effectively lead virtual teams in online education. A decisive sampling method was used to identify 10 experienced academic leaders who supervise virtual teams. As a result of the interviews, seven major themes emerged: (a) training and development; (b) trust; (c) emotional intelligence; (d) communication/team building/technology; (e) employee recognition and motivation; (f) leadership styles; and (g) virtual leadership competencies unique to higher education. Based on these themes and further evaluation, the need for specific soft skills and robust technology emerged. Specifically, organizational success partially hinges on comprehensive training for virtual leaders, the significance of trust, emotional intelligence, and effective, respectful communication.},

Indeed, the effective and efficient application of data mining methods entail many decisions, ranging from how to define student's success , through which student attributes to focus on , up to which machine learning method is more appropriate to the given problem . This study aims to provide a step-by-step set of guidelines for educators willing to apply data mining techniques to predict student success. For this, the literature has been reviewed, and the state-of-the-art has been compiled into a systematic process, where possible decisions and parameters are comprehensively covered and explained along with arguments.

  abstract = {This study aimed at examining EFL teachers' perceptions of the effectiveness of an OPD program provided by a Saudi University. The program lasted for almost one year, and consisted of different courses about teaching English language. An online questionnaire was sent to the teachers to examine their perceptions of the effectiveness of the program through examining teachers' perceptions of the significant features of the program, their learning in the program, and their use of the new knowledge and skills. Findings indicated limitations in teachers' positive perceptions of the features of the OPD courses, teachers' learning, and teachers' use of new skills and knowledge. Providers of OPD need to take into consideration teachers' needs and preferences, and the obstacles that might inhibit teachers' learning. Needs analysis might be helpful to discover their needs and preferences and solutions for the obstacles they face.},

The study seeks to evaluate how the synchronization content with immediate assessment can affect the knowledge performance of the students. An experimental design with digital formative assessment tools was used to fulfill the research purpose. Participants were 64 undergraduate students enrolled in is introduction to computer and programming (CSC 101) at Qassim University. The students from level five were divided into two-treatment groups: online learning \& assessment instruction in Synchronization form using Nearpod, and PowerPoint instruction with traditional form. The experiment was completed within 6 weeks. Formative assessment test was used to access students learning performance after class. Descriptive statistics and a t-test were used to analyze the data. Our findings revealed that the use of OLASF was an intrinsic motivation and could be a promising way of enhancing students' learning performance.},

The concept of teaching presence is constitutively defined as having three categories -- design and organization, facilitating discourse, and direct instruction. Indicators that we search for in the computer conference transcripts identify each category. Pilot testing of the instrument reveals interesting differences in the extent and type of teaching presence found in different graduate level online courses.},

These characteristics effectively deny distance education students the opportunity to participate in communities of inquiry and, perhaps, opportunities to develop their critical thinking skills. This paper reviews the theoretical impact of socially situated learning, critical thinking and their implications for distance education. It then presents the results from a study of learners' perceptions while enrolled in two different models of audio teleconferenced delivered, university courses. The study reports quantitative results from a mail survey of these students and the qualitative results from interviews and classroom observations. The impact of the instructional design used by the delivering institution resulted in two distinct models of audio teleconference delivery with significant qualitative and quantitative differences in student perception. The paper concludes that learning communities, which support the development of critical thinking skills, can be created at a distance and that they provide a mechanism for improving the quality of higher level distance education.},

  abstract = {No topic raises more contentious debate among educators than the role of interaction as a crucial component of the education process. This debate is fueled by surface problems of definition and vested interests of professional educators, but is more deeply marked by epistemological assumptions relative to the role of humans and human interaction in education and learning. The seminal article by Daniel and Marquis (1979) challenged distance educators to get the mixture right between independent study and interactive learning strategies and activities. They quite rightly pointed out that these two primary forms of education have differing economic, pedagogical, and social characteristics, and that we are unlikely to find a {\quotesinglbase}{\"A}{\'u}perfect{\quotesinglbase}{\"A}{\`u} mix that meets all learner and institutional needs across all curricula and content. Nonetheless, hard decisions have to be made. Even more than in 1979, the development of newer, cost effective technologies and the nearly ubiquitous (in developed countries) Net-based telecommunications system is transforming, at least, the cost and access implications of getting the mix right. Further, developments in social cognitive based learning theories are providing increased evidence of the importance of collaborative activity as a component of all forms of education {\quotesinglbase}{\"A}{\`i} including those delivered at a distance. Finally, the context in which distance education is developed and delivered is changing in response to the capacity of the semantic Web (Berners-Lee, 1999) to support interaction, not only amongst humans, but also between and among autonomous agents and human beings. Thus, the landscape and challenges of {\quotesinglbase}{\"A}{\'u}getting the mix right{\quotesinglbase}{\"A}{\`u} have not lessened in the past 25 years, and, in fact, have become even more complicated. This paper attempts to provide a theoretical rationale and guide for instructional designers and teachers interested in developing distance education systems that are both effective and efficient in meeting diverse student learning needs.},

  abstract = {The role of social presence as defined by the community of inquiry (CoI) framework is critiqued through a review of recent literature. Evidence is presented that questions the actual extent of knowledge co-construction that occurs in most higher education settings and therefore challenges the framework's underlying assumption of the need for sustained, contiguous, two-way communication in higher-level online learning environments. The CoI framework has evolved from the description of a learning process within a social constructivist paradigm to an empirically testable construct in an objectivist paradigm. Related research results indicate that social presence does not impact cognitive presence in a meaningful way and that best teaching practices suggested by CoI-based studies are informed by objectivist, cognitively oriented learning theories. These suggest that higher-order cognition may be achieved through wide and varied combinations of learner--teacher, learner--content, and learner--learner interaction. Controlled studies can and should be undertaken to compare learning outcomes using sustained, contiguous, two-way communication to other learning models. To facilitate this, subcategories of social and teaching presences need to be revamped and analysis adjusted to separate processes that support explicitly group-based learning activities from those used by individual students.},

  abstract = {The lockdown of March and April 2020 as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic has forced relevant changes in the educational environment in a very short period of time, making it necessary to suspend in-person instruction and generating the need to implement virtual learning mechanisms. In a future post-COVID-19 hybrid educational model, it will be necessary for university teachers to acquire an optimal degree of digital competence, as a combination of different competencies, namely, (i) technical, (ii) digital, and (iii) soft. Soft skills have been shown to have a decisive influence on the development of digital competence. The aim of this study was to analyze the degree of acquisition of soft skills in Latin American university teachers whose countries are less digitally developed. For this purpose, the countries with the lowest Global Innovation Index (GII) were selected: (i) Panama; (ii) Peru; (iii) Argentina; (iv) El Salvador; (v) Ecuador; (vi) Paraguay; (vii) Honduras; and (viii) Bolivia. To achieve this objective, it was necessary to develop a questionnaire on the self-concept of soft skills, based on the soft skills included in the Bochum Inventory of Personality and Competences (BIP). Results obtained from statistical analysis of the data collected from a sample of 219 participants show that university teachers are sufficiently prepared, in terms of their soft skills, for the increase in digital competence required as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, despite the low level of digital development in their respective countries.},

Action research was selected as the methodology as it was considered to be the least intrusive and provides a process for continuous improvement of the program. The challenges and successes to addressing fluency in the Anishinaabe language is a unique portrayal of life in this First Nation community. Currently, the pedagogical strategies utilised have dramatically increased the level of fluency for this First Nation community. Documentation of these teaching strategies have proven useful for the Walpole Island First Nation and it is anticipated that many Indigenous communities around the world may benefit from adapting these strategies as appropriate for their circumstances.}

Rather than beginning with the assumption that face-to-face education is the prototype for quality, the authors appraise the online learning environment as a unique medium which, by its nature, necessitates unique communication, community-building, teaching and learning strategies. This paper proposes an in-depth analysis of the potential unique affordances associated with online learning contexts as existing in their own right. The concepts of community and communication are explored in relation to online Communities of Practice (CoPs). The nature of face-to-face and online learning contexts are considered, especially in the light of the possibility of redefining "face-to-face" within the online realm, in addition to physical learning contexts. The paper identifies unique ways in which online communication (in the context of learning) is different from face-to-face communication, and consequently four ways in which this can be an advantage for students; namely, there is a measure of social egalitarianism, emphasis on verbal/written proficiency, time for reasoned response, and social agency. The paper provides grounding for further research into strategies that forge rich online learning experiences and suggests an empirical study as a next step.},

I explore the effectiveness, vulnerabilities, and ethical implications of AI detection tools in the context of preserving academic integrity. My analysis synthesizes insights from various case studies, newspaper articles, and student testimonies to scrutinize the practical and philosophical challenges associated with AI detection. I argue that reliance on detection mechanisms is misaligned with the educational landscape, where AI plays an increasing role. I advocate for a strategic shift toward robust assessment methods and educational policies that embrace GenAI usage while ensuring academic integrity and authenticity in assessments.},

Course assessment is important because it has a strong impact on learning and is an indicator of the quality of learning occurring in a class. In the online environment, methods of assessment can be very different. However, the online education literature is currently lacking empirical data about the general status of assessment practices or how those practices relate to student learning. This article lays the groundwork for future studies by providing a description of formative and summative assessment and learning strategies in 60 online courses and suggesting some ways that assessment practices lead to different types of learning. In this study, instructors appear to follow effective practice by using multiple and alternativeassessment methods, dispersing grades over time, and providing timely and frequent feedback to students. Students report focusing on relatively more complex learning strategies, such as elaboration and critical thinking over rehearsal. However, online instructors need to ensure that assessments are used strategically and that feedback is productive and able to be acted upon by students.},

  abstract = {The Research on Open Educational Resources for Development (ROER4D) project was undertaken to provide a better understanding of the uptake of Open Educational Resources (OER) and their impact on education in the Global South. The 18 sub-projects that comprise the larger project investigated the extent of OER adoption by educators and students; the factors influencing OER adoption; and the impact of OER adoption on access to educational resources, the quality of teaching and learning, and some of the costs of education provision in 21 countries in South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. The findings of each of the sub-projects are discussed in the various chapters comprising this volume, and a meta-synthesis of these findings is presented in Chapter 2. Using a social realist lens, the meta-synthesis provides a comparative analysis of OER use, adaptation and creation across the research sites, and identifies the structural, cultural and agential factors that enable and constrain these Open Educational Practices (OEP). It points out disjunctures in adoption processes in the countries and institutions studied, and draws insights regarding the extent to which OER adoption can expand access to educational materials, enhance the quality of educational resources and educators' pedagogical perspectives and practices, and improve the affordability and sustainability of education in the Global South. This concluding chapter explores the implications of the main research findings presented in the meta-synthesis for the attainment of social inclusion, which lies at the heart of the Open Education movement. The Paris OER Declaration of 2012 explicitly calls upon states to ``[p]romote and use OER to {\dots} contribut[e] to social inclusion, gender equity and special needs education [and i]mprove both cost-efficiency and quality of teaching and learning outcomes'' (emphasis added). The Ljubljana OER Action Plan of 2017 likewise recognises that, ``[t]oward the realization of inclusive Knowledge Societies ... [OER] support quality education that is equitable, inclusive, open and participatory''. Understanding how OER, OEP and Open Education more generally, can help to achieve social inclusion is particularly critical in the Global South where increased demand, lack of resources and high costs limit the capacity of education systems to provide accessible, relevant, highquality and affordable education. This chapter aims to contribute to this understanding the potential of OER and their accompanying OEP through a critical exploration of the ROER4D findings in terms of whether and how OER adoption promotes equitable access, participatory education and empowerment of teachers and students, and thus helps to achieve social inclusion. The chapter begins with a brief overview of the relationship between OER and social inclusion, details the implications of ROER4D's findings as they pertain to social inclusion, and concludes with recommendations for advocacy, policy, practice and further research in OER and OEP in the Global South.},

Building on a previous study conducted in 2013, this article thus covers an exploratory review of the literature for the period 2103-2017. It analyses 49 articles which explore both the specific concept of e-leadership as well as other work dealing more generally with leadership and organisational change for TEL in higher education. The findings show that while none of the empirical studies identified in the literature refer explicitly to e-leadership, there are a number of interesting insights to be found in the theoretical articles. The results also highlight the widely different interpretations and applications of the concept of e-leadership and the consequent need for the definition to be refined. The paper concludes with recommendations for further multidisciplinary research at the intersection of the fields of educational technology and educational management, focusing on values, strategy, organisation and leadership interactions at meso level, the economy and public policy at macro level, and teaching and learning at the micro level, as well as for research in Leadership Development for TEL.},

We argue for a more critical stance regarding the existing claims related authentic assessment to ensure that the field remains evidence informed. From a position where we wholeheartedly believe in the aims and approaches of the authentic assessment movement, we conclude that for the sake of coherence and clarity, we should stop using the term ?authentic assessment? and instead turn our attention to focus on the component characteristics.}

This, alongside growing student numbers in higher education, creates pedagogic challenges, especially with regards to assessment design. Conventional assessment modalities, such as individual essay writing, are costly to scale up and poorly suited for the development of further desired competencies. To address these challenges in the context of a first-year economics module, we replaced a 1,000-word individual written assignment with a group video assignment, where students were required to work in small teams to create a three-minute video on a contemporary economic issue. Focus groups and module evaluation questionnaires were used to elicit students' perceptions of how the group video assessment contributed to their learning experience and skill development, how it compares with other modes of assessment, as well as suggestions for improved implementation. Our analysis generates insights on all these aspects. Students reported a preference for diversity in assessment methods, and found the video assignment to be a positive, engaging but also challenging experience, which provided the opportunity for collaboration and development of diverse skills.},

The work was built on a belief that our respective higher education undergraduate students did not fully value the design structure or feedback outcomes inherent in CRA. Using a collaborative autoethnographic lens we pooled experiences, outcomes, challenges, assumptions, and accounts of unconscious biases from across our different tertiary education schools and subjects. Our examination enriched our understanding, our teaching, and our student outcomes. In sharing our journey we offer three unique, yet jointly considered perspectives on using CRA to extend and enhance learning.},

  abstract = {In this article, I examine the educational purposes of higher education in terms of the societal outcomes of educating students through higher education. Based on an analysis of the first 80 volume of Higher Education, published from 1972 to 2020, I argue that discussions of societal educational purposes were dominated by authors from the Anglophone, global North and these authors were more likely to write as if the educational purposes under discussion were relevant to all higher education systems regardless of national context. This tendency increased over time. The overall models of the educational purposes in each contribution differed in terms of whether they focused on single, multiple, or differentiated sets of educational purposes. I argue that as higher education has become increasingly stratified, there has been less discussion of whether there are differences in the societal outcomes served by different forms of higher education. This is problematic because it obscures the potential differences in the educational purposes of higher education in different societies and the extent to which inequalities are perpetuated by differences in the forms of higher education to which students gain access. In order to address this, I argue there is a need to move away from a focus on the educational purposes of the institutional form of `the University' to focus on the educational purposes that are served by different configurations of higher education systems.},

The steps took during the day were measured by bio-electric impedance method and data about their nutrition, sleep, residence and internet use have been collected via information form and then this information was evaluated. Whether or not data followed a normal distribution was assessed and Non-Parametric Mann Whitney U Test was used for assessments. According to findings; average number of students' daily steps was 11,063{\textpm}2198 in male students while it was 10,308{\textpm}1829 in female students. There was no significant difference in terms of academic schools where the students attended (p{$>$}0.05) whereas there were significant differences in terms of sex variable among male students of SPES and EF as compared to female students in the parameters of BMI, body fat ratio and residence place (p{$<$}0.05). Besides, there were also significant differences in the number of weekly steps among students of both schools in terms of doing sports variable (p{$<$}0.05). However; no statistically significant differences were found in terms of students' internet use, daily sleep length, transportation to schools and number of weekly total steps (p{$<$}0.05). As a result, it was noted that physical activity levels of the female and male students were "active" according to literature criteria and average number of daily steps of those students who regularly did sports was high as expected.},

By using purposive sampling method, the sample consisted of 270 (200 female and 70 male) student teachers in Turkey. Data collection tools include (i) Student Demographics Form with 18 items, (ii) On-line Learning Readiness Scale with 18 items and five factors. Statistically, the quantitative data were analyzed via ANOVA, t-test and ANCOVA. The findings suggest that mean of on-line learning readiness levels of student teachers is at good level. On-line learning readiness levels of student teachers are significantly different according to their departments [F(4,265)=3.450, p=0.09]. Namely, the mean scores for the students from Elementary Education and Pre-school Education departments were significantly higher than those from Social Science Education department. Besides, student teachers who has Internet access had higher on-line learning readiness scores (M= 67.27, SD=9.86) than did those without access (M= 60.14, SD=10.64), t(268)=3.16, p=0.002. There are also significant differences between student teachers' on-line learning readiness scores per their perceived information and communication technology use competency and departments after differences in accessibility to the Internet is controlled (p{$<$}0.001). As mentioned by International Society for Technology in Education in 2019 standards, on-line learning readiness needs to be considered in detail to assist learners in using digital media in 21st century for learning; teaching; gathering, producing, sharing information for educational purposes. In conclusion, it is suggested that practitioners should increase online, distance or blended (both on-line and face-to-face) learning experiences of their students who are prospective teachers of the 21st century learners. Therefore, it is strongly suggested contributing development of learning and teaching skills of student teachers by getting them more familiar with on-line learning environments especially in post-COVID times.},

  abstract = {Despite the implied importance of comparative Indigenous studies, little has been written about global Indigenous courses. There are two sets of literature wherein one might expect to find such a conversation. The first, literature on teaching globally, generally does not consider or include Indigenous issues (Rothwell, 2005; Stanley \& Plaza, 2002). Discussions of teaching globally tend to focus on "global awareness" as a socioeconomic problem, centring on students' abilities to situate their knowledge in global contexts (Gibson, Rimmington, \& Landwehr-Brown, 2008). What might be described as the "development" model considers topics like housing, the effects of transnational corporations, poverty, food security, and internal political crisis and conflict ([Peterson, Patti McGill], 2012). A corollary of this model takes an anti-capitalism stance, whereby globalization is invariably posited as a tool of exploitation (McLaren \& Farahmandpur, 2001). In both models, Indigenous peoples are viewed in the context of other disadvantaged or "develop- "develop- ing" populations in classrooms that seek to teach racial tolerance and cultural diversity (Fanghanel \& Cousin, 2012). Multiculturalism is thus taken to an international level to promote tolerance and dispel negative stereotypes. The emphasis is on teaching students to be responsible "global citizens" who are engaged in and aware of global issues and problems, especially those in African, Latin American, and South Asian countries. Violations against community well-being are thus posited in the context of modern human rights and environmental issues, not of continuing historical colonialism. Indigenous peoples become conflated with "the poor" or "victimized" (although indeed they are often both), in contrast to students as citizens of privileged, "developed" nations who are taught about their social responsibilities to "save" victimized peoples.}

Continuing professional development programmes (CPD) are central to such strategic approaches that equip educators with essential knowledge and skills to handle diversity related issues, achieve equity and increase student participation. Therefore, the present study aims to examine strategies used by higher education practitioners to address diversity and inclusion in teaching and learning. Methodology: Participants comprised nine academicians (six men and three women) who emerged from natural retention along the iterative cycles on community of practice (CoP) participation. This study adopted CoP as the theoretical lens and methodological tool to understand the strategies higher education practitioners have devised for their inclusive teaching and learning practices in response to diversity related challenges. The data was collected through a series of observations and reflective journals. Initially, thematic analysis techniques were used to reduce data into two categories--strategies and challenges. Later, according to prevalence and frequency counts, the strategies were analysed against the challenges reported and finally the strategies were reduced to major themes. Findings: Three major themes emerged which reported on the inclusive strategies conceived by the participants. The themes were inclusive/differentiated assessment which suggested that creating differentiated assessment that were inclusive in nature could provide equal opportunities for each and every student to participate. The second theme, motivation and goal strategies revealed that students were diverse in their goals for learning. Hence, a variety of motivational strategies such as including students' voice, providing them with a clear rationale for studying and fostering relatedness were deemed suitable to address these differences. The final theme, inclusive pedagogy suggested a variety of accommodation to be made in pedagogy such as integrating technology, adopting culturally responsive material and initiating collaborative learning to address students' differences. Significance: The findings have implications for faculty professional development, classroom teaching practices employing inclusive pedagogy in higher education institutions and the use of CoP as a framework for such developments.},

Based on collaborative procedures, internet resources -- both pre-existing and freely available as well as resources specifically conceived by the project team -- and communities of practices, MathE intends to be a tool to nurture and stimulate the learning of Mathematics in higher education. This study introduces and describes the MathE platform, which is divided into three sections: Student's Assessment, Library and Community of Practice. An in-depth description of the Student's Assessment section is presented and an analysis of the results obtained from students, when using this feature of the platform, is also provided. After this, and based on the answers to an online survey, the impact of the MathE platform among students and teachers of eight countries is shown. Although the number of collected results is still scarce, it allows the recognition of a trend regarding the use of the material of the Student's Assessment section for autonomous study. The results indicate the platform is well organized, with a satisfactory amount and diversity of questions and good interconnection between the various parts. Nevertheless, both teachers and students indicate that more questions should be introduced. The overall opinion about the MathE platform is very favourable.},

  abstract = {The increasing influence of sociocultural theories of learning on assessment practices in second language education necessitates an expansion of the knowledge base that teacher-assessors need to develop (what teachers need to know) and related changes in the processes of language teacher education (how they learn and develop it). Teacher assessors need to acquire concepts from diverse assessment paradigms; they need to learn to use these concepts in developing, using and analysing assessment procedures and results; they need to exercise critical perspectives on their own assessment practices for particular purposes in diverse contexts, especially in seeking to do justice to all in education. In this paper I argue that, to develop language assessment literacy with the dual goals of transforming teacher assessment practices and developing teacher understanding of the phenomenon of assessment itself and themselves as assessors, it is necessary to reconsider both the knowledge base and the complex processes of language teacher education. I draw on projects I have conducted on developing and investigating teacher understanding and practices in second language assessment, to discuss the need to work with the often tacit preconceptions, beliefs, understandings and world-views about assessment that teacher-assessors bring to teacher professional learning programs and that inform their conceptualizations, interpretations, judgments and decisions in assessment. I discuss the need in developing language assessment literacy for processes that develop teacher-assessors' capability to explore and evaluate their own preconceptions so as to become aware of how they interpret their own assessment practices and their students' second language learning. Through these processes they develop a deeper understanding of the interpretive nature of assessment and their own self-awareness as assessors.}

The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence and appropriateness of current assessment methods for engineering and technology students in Nigerian and British HEIs. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a qualitative research method with a case study approach to investigate the impact and suitability of assessment methods currently used within entrepreneurship education in Nigeria and England. Findings: The results reveal that lecturers across both countries believed that assessment methods currently in use were appropriate, but were not uniform in its influence on learning. However, students were unanimous in that most assessment methods currently used were not effective at enhancing their learning, not very appropriate, and were not a good judge of their work and effort. The results were used in building a framework to understand the importance of assessment methods in entrepreneurship education. Originality/value: In light of the inadequate literature, this paper covers an acute gap in the field. This will allow policymakers and different interested parties to reassess the development of suitable assessment methods to involve students as key stakeholders.},

  abstract = {Aim/Purpose: The aim of this study is to understand student's opinions and perceptions about e-assessment when the assessment process was changed from the traditional computer assisted method to a multiple-choice Moodle based method. Background: In order to implement continuous assessment to a large number of students, several shifts are necessary, which implies as many different tests as the number of shifts required. Consequently, it is difficult to ensure homogeneity through the different tests and a huge amount of grading time is needed. These problems related to the traditional assessment based on computer assisted tests, lead to a re-design of the assessment resulting in the use of multiple-choice Moodle tests.  Methodology: A longitudinal, concurrent, mixed method study was implemented over a five-year period. A survey was developed and carried out by 815 undergraduate students who experienced the electronic multiple-choice questions (eMCQ) assessment in the courses of the IS department. Qualitative analyses included open-ended survey responses and interviews with repeating students in the first year. Contribution: This study provides a reflection tool on how to incorporate frequent moments of assessment in courses with a high number of students without overloading teachers with a huge workload. The research analysed the efficiency of assessing non-theoretical topics using eMCQ, while ensuring the homogeneity of assessment tests, which needs to be complemented with other assessment methods in order to assure that students develop and acquire the expected skills and competencies. Findings: The students involved in the study appreciate the online multiple-choice quiz assessment method and perceive it as fair but have a contradictory opinion regarding the preference of the assessment method, throughout the years. These changes in perception may be related to the improvement of the question bank and categorisation of questions according to difficulty level, which lead to the nullification of the `luck factor'. Other major findings are that although the online multiple-choice quizzes are used with success in the assessment of theoretical topics, the same is not in evidence regarding practical topics. Therefore, this assessment needs to be complemented with other methods in order to achieve the expected learning outcomes. Recommendations for Practitioners: In order to be able to evaluate the same expected learning outcomes in practical topics, particularly in technology and information systems subjects, the evaluator should complement the online multiple-choice quiz assessment with other approaches, such as a PBL method, homework assignments, and/or other tasks performed during the semester. Recommendation for Researchers: This study explores e-assessment with online multiple-choice quizzes in higher education. It provides a survey that can be applied in other institutions that are also using online multiple-choice quizzes to assess non-theorical topics. In order to better understand the students' opinions on the development of skills and competencies with online multiple-choice quizzes and on the other hand with classical computer assisted assessment, it would be necessary to add questions concerning these aspects. It would then be interesting to compare the findings of this study with the results from other institutions. Impact on Society: The increasing number of students in higher education has led to a raised use of e-assessment activities, since it can provide a fast and efficient manner to assess a high number of students. Therefore, this research provides meaningful insight of the stakeholders' perceptions of online multiple-choice quizzes about practical topics. Future Research: An interesting study, in the future, would be to obtain the opinions of a particular set of students on two tests, one of the tests using online multiple-choice quizzes and the other through a classical computer assisted assessment method. A natural extension of the present study is a comparative analysis regarding the grades obtained by students who performed one or another type of assessment (online multiple-choice quizzes vs. classical computer assisted assessment).},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic created a situation for the implementation of emergency remote learning. This meant that as a lecturer at a traditionalist University of contact sessions, the pandemic forced us to teach remotely through online methods of communication, using online lectures, narrated powerpoints, voice clips, podcasts, interviews and interactive videos. The assessments were conducted online from assignments to multiple choice questions, which forced the lecturers to think differently about the way the assessments were presented, in order to avoid easy access to answers found in a textbook and online. This meant that more application questions of theory to practice were assessed in a more challenging way to prevent cheating and collaboration with peers. Formal assessments completed during emergency remote learning, have become the past practice, as innovative methods have been adopted for learning and for assessment purposes in order to preserve the integrity and attainment of the degree through online modes of learning. The aim of the paper investigates and explores the methods of teaching, together with the results obtained from the students of 2019 and 2020 in their final year relating to two final year modules against the literature relating to learning processes and methodologies.},

The intervention study explores student responses to and use of a specific digital tool implemented for a specific pedagogical purpose, namely to enhance formative assessment. The data consist of 128 reflection notes written by 40 student teachers during a semester and a focus group interview with three of the students. The results show that the students' attitudes towards the new tool varied considerably. Both the attitudes and the reported use were overwhelmingly related to the perceived ease of use, rather than the learning-related potential of digital technology. On the other hand, the interview data show that at least some students are aware of the affordances provided by the digital tool for enhancing formative assessment. The article highlights that the transformational potential of digital artifacts rests on teachers and learners alike. The students need to be made aware of the pedagogical, and not just the practical, aspects of digital technology, and be willing to exploit it. The article concludes that more fundamental changes in students' working habits and their expectations of higher education may be required to truly harness the transformational power of digital technology.},

  abstract = {Educational systems have advanced with the use of electronic learning (e-learning), which is a promising solution for long-distance learners. Students who engage in e-learning can access tests and exams online, making education more flexible and accessible. This work reports on the design of an e-learning system that makes recommendations to students to improve their learning. This artificial intelligence-based student assessment and recommendation (AISAR) system consists of score estimation, clustering, performance prediction, and recommendation. In addition, the importance of student authentication is recognised in situations in which students must authenticate themselves prior to using the e-learning system using their identity, password, and personal identification number. Individual scores are determined using a recurrent neural network (RNN) based on student engagement and examination scores. Then, a density-based spatial clustering algorithm (DBSCAN) using Mahalanobis distance clustering is implemented to group students based on their obtained score values. The constructed clusters are validated by estimating purity and entropy. Student performance is predicted using a threshold-based MapReduce (TMR) procedure from the score-based cluster. When predicting student performance, students are classified into two groups: average and poor, with the former being divided into below- and above-average students and the latter into poor and very poor students. This categorisation aims to provide useful recommendations for learning. A recommendation reinforcement learning algorithm, the rule-based state--action--reward--state--action (R-SARSA) algorithm, is incorporated for evaluation. Students were required to work on their subjects according to the provided recommendations. This e-learning recommendation system achieves better performance in terms of true-positives, false-positives, true-negatives, false-negatives, precision, recall, and accuracy.},

  abstract = {The COVID pandemic forced many higher education institutions to pivot and switch to an online learning environment with minimal preparation. This transition was put in place during the middle of the spring semester, in March. During this transition, instructors had to quickly learn the tools of online teaching, navigate platforms like Webex and Zoom, and adapt their lectures to an online format. One of the biggest challenges during this transition was to administer common online exams to high enrollment undergraduate classes, such as general chemistry and organic chemistry, without compromising the integrity of the exam. The in-person chemistry common exam that is normally administered to students at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) had both multiple-choice and open-ended questions. In order to replicate this online, and to reduce the potential temptation to cheat, a robust multiple-choice and open-ended exam with multiple versions was required. Furthermore, this online exam had to be easily administered through our learning management system. What was developed included a blueprint for an online exam intended for large-scale distribution over multiple days with safeguards in place to protect the integrity of the examination. The exam employed deferred grading, a lockdown browser, multiple question variants, time controls, and controlled access to the completed exam to combat potential cheating. The exam resulted in average scores that were comparable to in-person exam scores from previous semesters, validating the proposed approach. In addition, polling results after administration of the exam showed strong student satisfaction with exam design and directions and student preference for webcam proctored exams.},

This study investigates how evaluation instruments used in higher education assess the "Seven Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education," and what other items are addressed in the evaluation of courses. Findings show that national and statewide evaluation instruments were less institute specific and more closely aligned to the principles of good practice, and that evaluation instruments often measure extraneous items (e.g., student services, navigation, resources, or institutional support). Additional findings and conclusions based on the analysis of the instruments are discussed.},

  abstract = {Online and blended learning have become common educational strategy in higher education. Lecturers have to re-theorise certain basic concerns of teaching, learning and assessment in non-traditional environments. These concerns include perceptions such as cogency and trustworthiness of assessment in online environments in relation to serving the intended purposes, as well as understanding how formative assessment operates within online learning environment. Of importance also is the issue of how formative assessment benefits both the student learning and teaching within pedagogical strategies in an online context. This paper's concern is how online formative assessment provides teaching and learning as well as how lecturers and students benefit from it. A mixed method questionnaire on formative assessment with a main focus on how formative assessment within online contexts operates was used to collect data from courses using Blackboard. Lecturers and students at a comprehensive university were the population. Various techniques for formative assessment linked with online tools such as discussion forums and objective tests were used. The benefits that were famous comprise improvement of student commitment, faster feedback, enhanced flexibility around time and place of taking the assessment task and importance in the procedure for students and lecturers also benefited with less marking time and saved on administrative costs. The crucial findings are that effective online formative assessment can nurture a student and assessment centred focus through formative feedback and enrich student commitment with valued learning experiences. Ongoing trustworthy assessment tasks and interactive formative feedback were identified as significant features that will deal with intimidations to rationality and trustworthiness within the milieu of online formative assessment.},

  abstract = {In higher education, one commonly used teaching approach that is intended to develop deep learning is that of the `Oxford' tutorial---a personalized Socratic approach in which an instructor discusses course-related issues with a handful of students. Even though this conventional tutorial model is well supported in the literature, it may be neglected by research-driven academics and is expensive to operate. The latter issue has placed tutorials in the spotlight because higher education institutions are facing huge funding cuts worldwide. In light of these problems, a scoping review was conducted to explore financially viable alternatives to the Oxford tutorial for management education. Articles in highly ranked management education and development academic journals were collected by searching these catalogs and compiling a database of 48 articles published in four premier journals. These articles were reviewed by two independent raters in order to arrive at 8 alternatives to the Oxford tutorial model that can achieve similar objectives of said tutorials while reducing costs. These alternative tutorial models all involve the application of information communication technologies to tutorials and include peer instruction, simulations and games, online collaborative learning, syndicates, flipped classrooms, communication systems, tailored learning, and portfolios. Challenges and implementation guidelines are explained for each alternative tutorial model.},

  abstract = {8Factor AnalysisExploratory and ConfirmatoryDeborah L. Bandalos and Sara J. FinneyFactor  analysis  is  a  method  of  modeling  the  covariation  among  a  set  of  observed  variables  as  a  function of one or more latent constructs. Here, we use the term construct to refer to an unobservable but  theoretically  defensible  entity,  such  as  intelligence,  self-efficacy,  or  creativity.  Such  constructs  are typically considered to be latent in the sense that they are not directly observable (see Bollen, 2002, for a more detailed discussion of latent constructs). The purpose of factor analysis is to assist researchers in identifying and/or understanding the nature of the latent constructs underlying the variables of interest. Technically, these descriptions exclude component analysis, which is a method for reducing the dimensionality of a set of observed variables through the creation of an optimum number of weighted composites. A major difference between factor and component analysis is that in the latter all of the variance is analyzed, whereas in factor analysis, only the shared (common) var-iance is analyzed. For this reason, factor analysis is sometimes referred to as common factor analysis. In many ways, however, component analysis is very similar to common factor analysis, and many of the desiderata for exploratory factor analysis presented here apply equally to component analy-sis. Given that the goal of component analysis is to explain as much observed variance as possible via the weighted composites and not, as in common factor analysis, to model the relations among variables as functions of underlying latent variables, those desiderata relating to the importance of theory for factor analysis do not necessarily apply to component analysis (see Widaman, 2007, for a detailed explanation of the conceptual and mathematical distinction between exploratory factor analysis and principal components analysis). This is because, although components may represent constructs, component analysis can still have utility as a data reduction method even if the compo-nents themselves are not interpreted. In such cases, the components do not provide an explanation for the variables' shared variance, but are instead used to represent that shared variance in the most parsimonious manner possible},

Previous studies have been focused on changes in student engagement from using mobile applications in the classroom, whereas there has been little research on the impact of mobile applications on student assessment. This research uses a quasi-experimental study to examine the relationship between student assessment and the use of a mobile application. Two groups of students (a control and an experimental group) were tested in the same academic semester with the same lecturer. Two analyses were carried out (t-test and difference-in-differences) to evaluate this relationship. Contrary to the general expectations, the results showed that there is no significant difference on assessment when comparing the two groups' scores. However, students showed a positive attitude in engaging with the mobile application. Although there has been an increase on the use of mobile applications in classrooms, they do not directly affect student scores. This research shows that mobile applications should be used as a complement to traditional education, and not as a substitute to it.},

Proponents of two kinds of approaches to model fit can be identified: those who adhere strictly to the result from a null hypothesis significance test, and those who ignore this and instead index model fit as an approximation function. Both have principled reasons for their respective course of action. This paper argues that the chi-square exact-fit test is the only substantive test of fit for SEM, but, its sensitivity to discrepancies from expected values at increasing sample sizes can be highly problematic if those discrepancies are considered trivial from an explanatory-theory perspective. On the other hand, suitably scaled indices of approximate fit do not possess this sensitivity to sample size, but neither are they ``tests'' of model fit. The proposed solution to this dilemma is to consider the substantive ``consequences'' of accepting one explanatory model over another in terms of the predictive accuracy of theory-relevant-criteria. If there are none to be evaluated, then it is proposed that no scientifically worthwhile distinction between ``competing'' models can thus be made, which of course begs the question as to why such a SEM application was undertaken in the first place.},

  abstract = {This is a process article for weaving indigenous and mainstream knowledges within science educational curricula and other science arenas, assuming participants include recognized holders of traditional ecological knowledge (we prefer ``Indigenous Knowledge'' or ``Traditional Knowledge'') and others with expertise in mainstream science. It is based on the ``Integrative Science'' undergraduate program created at Cape Breton University to bring together indigenous and mainstream sciences and ways of knowing, as well as related Integrative Science endeavors in science research, application, and outreach. A brief historical outline for that experiential journey is provided and eight ``Lessons Learned'' listed. The first, namely ``acknowledge that we need each other and must engage in a co-learning journey'' is explained as key for the success of weaving efforts. The second, namely ``be guided by Two-Eyed Seeing'', is considered the most profound because it is central to the whole of a co-learning journey and the article's discussion is focussed through it. The eighth lesson, ``develop an advisory council of willing, knowledgeable stakeholders'', is considered critical for sustaining success over the long-term given that institutional and community politics profoundly influence the resourcing and recruitment of any academic program and thus can help foster success, or sabotage it. The scope of relevance for Two-Eyed Seeing is broad and its uptake across Canada is sketched; the article also places it in the context of emerging theory for transdisciplinary research. The article concludes with thoughts on why ``Two-Eyed Seeing'' may seem to be desired or resisted as a label in different settings.Traditional Indian education is an expression of environmental education par excellence. It is an environmental education process that can have a profound meaning for the kind of modern education required to face the challenges of living in the world of the twenty-first century (Cajete (2010), p. 1128, emphasis as in original).As two-eyed seeing implies, people familiar with both knowledge systems can uniquely combine the two in various ways to meet a challenge or task at hand. In the context of environmental crises alone, a combination of both seems essential (Aikenhead and Michell (2011), p. 114).},

  abstract = {Effective assessment design and subsequent assessment practices are essential for student success in the higher education sector. A plethora of research on assessment in higher education exists which tends to focus primarily on the student experience. This paper shares results from a 3 phased study that explored staff perceptions related to assessment practices in an undergraduate Initial Teacher Education program within an Australian metropolitan university. First, course learning objectives, activities and assessment items were mapped to identify the presence of constructive alignment. Second, staff were invited to complete a survey and a follow-up interview in relation to understanding of assessment knowledge and skills. Fink's Taxonomy of Significant Learning (2013) was used to analyse the qualitative data and findings suggest that staff are highly committed to quality assessment practices but often work in silos rather than teams. Additionally, a lack of professional development and learning was available at the school level, particularly for casual staff. Further research about assessment practices in higher education in relation to staff rather than student experience is warranted. [Author abstract]},

  abstract = {The study sought to establish learner perceptions about assessment strategies in higher education. This was against the backdrop of an emerging trend in the field of assessment that has resulted in different perceptions of learners with respect of their effectiveness in higher education learning. The study in particular endeavored to determine the perceptions of learners in relation to formative and summative assessment, as predominantly adopted assessment strategies in higher education. Forty six learners doing research methods were conveniently chosen to represent the target population and were served with self-administered questionnaires. The instrument used enabled the researcher to obtain quality data as respondents were given ample time to complete the questionnaire with limited pressure. The results were indicative of the fact that learners perceived formative assessment as a critical ingredient for effective learning in higher education. Formative assessment methods such as group presentations and other forms of collaborative learning were also perceived to be critical in higher education learning. Respondents also indicated that they perceived summative assessment as playing an augmenting role. Thus the two assessment approaches are perceived to be strategically important in enhancing effective learning in higher education.},

  abstract = {Digital competence has gained a strong prominence in the educational context, being one of the key competencies that teachers must master in today's society. Although most models and frameworks focus on the pre-university level, there is a growing interest in knowing the state of digital competencies of university teachers, that is, the set of knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for a teacher to make effective use of technologies. The aim of this research is to present a systematic review of the literature in the Web of Science and Scopus, to identify, analyze and classify the published articles between 2000 and 2021 on digital competences, and thus find and improve the research being done on digital skills and future avenues of teachers in the university context. The SciMAT software is used in the analysis. The initial search reveals more than 343 articles in English, of which 152 are duplicates and 135 are not related to the topic of study. After this filtering, 56 articles are obtained and analyzed in depth. The results reveal a predominance of research that focuses on analyzing teachers' self-assessment and reflection of their digital competencies. Teachers recognize that they have a low or medium--low digital competence, as well as the absence of certain competencies, especially those related to the evaluation of educational practice. Despite the multiple studies that address this issue, it is necessary to continue improving research in this area, deepening the assessment of teachers' digital competencies and design, on this basis, more practical and personalized training programs that respond to the needs of teachers in the digital era.},

  abstract = {The World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared coronavirus (COVID-19) a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Educational institutions must change most face-to-face learning activities in class to online. This situation forces academic institutions to change the format of assessing student learning outcomes. Online exam surveillance applications utilizing cameras and other blocking browsers (proctors) are becoming popular. However, the appearance of the proctor model supervised exam system also raises controversy. The main discussion regarding this proctor system is the integrity of assessment and the capacity of students to adapt to this new method of supervision. The main question is whether students feel comfortable using the proctor system in exams and whether this system affects students' scores. To answer this question, we have analyzed the scores obtained from a trial of 152 scores of students learning Arabic at Hasanuddin University Makassar, Indonesia. The experiment involved three exam models: online format from home using the Sikola Learning Management System (Modality 1), online directly using the Proctor System in the Sikola Learning Management System (Modality 2), and a paper exam format in person under the supervision of a lecturer (Modality 3). The results show that students prefer Modality 1 (online at home with the Sikola LMS system). There is a statistical difference between the scores obtained by students from the three modalities analyzed. Student scores with modality 1 are higher than the other two modalities. On the other hand, there was no difference in scores between modalities 2 and 3. The online exam system (modality 2) can be applied to online exams in higher education institutions because it can reduce or even keep students from cheating.},

Although promising to make postsecondary education accessible to Aboriginal peoples, universities express an Aboriginal agenda in mission statements, priorities, and projects that reaffirm Eurocentric and colonial encounters in the name of excellence, integration, and modernity. Addressing these challenges is the purpose of a research project undertaken by a team of investigators at the University of Saskatchewan, building on the theoretical foundations of postcolonial Indigenous consciousness emerging from Canadian Aboriginal scholars and from Aotearoa (New Zealand) in the scholarly work of Graham and Linda Smith. This article offers a process of animating postsecondary education that can generate methods and practices for the more thorough decolonization of research and policy development and the experience of Aboriginal students and teachers.;Aboriginal peoples' achievements, knowledge, histories, and perspectives are often ignored or marginalized in universities across Canada and beyond. An interdisciplinary Indigenous research project aims to address the deficit in public understanding and animate a truly postcolonial university, focusing on Elders' guidance, research ethics, educational materials, legitimacy of Indigenous knowledge, hiring of Indigenous faculty, networking, and the Indigenous renaissance in the visual arts.

The study was carried out in 2017-2018 fall and spring with participants consisting of freshmen who took the online course in a state university (N[subscript fall]=1585; N[subscript spring]=1206). In this study exploratory factor analysis (EFA) (Study 1-N[subscript EFA]=921) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) (Study 1-N[subscript CFA]=664; Study 1-N[subscript CFA]=1206) were performed to assess the construct validity of the scale's measures. As proof of validity, the effect of gender on satisfaction was examined, for which independent sample t-test was performed. For the criterion validity, the relationship between computer and internet self-efficacy and satisfaction scores of the learners was examined. The finalized version of satisfaction scale, consisting of eight items, demonstrated that the scale is suitable for general use. Suggestions for future researchers and practitioners are proposed.},

It draws together literature from diverse domains, including educational technologies, assessment pedagogies and digital literacies. The framework describes three main purposes for designing the digital into assessment: 1) as a tool for improvement; 2) as a means to develop and credential digital literacies; and 3) as a means to develop and credential uniquely human capabilities. Within each purpose, it offers considerations for assessment and feedback design. In addition, it offers researchers analytical tools to understand the role of the digital in assessment. The framework seeks to connect assessment and feedback design to the digital world, and in so doing ensure that higher education will be relevant for graduates' digital futures.},

  abstract = {There are dissonances between educators' aspirations for assessment design and actual assessment implementation in higher education. Understanding how assessment is designed `on the ground' can assist in resolving this tension. Thirty-three Australian university educators from a mix of disciplines and institutions were interviewed. A thematic analysis of the transcripts indicated that assessment design begins as a response to an impetus for change. The design process itself was shaped by environmental influences, which are the circumstances surrounding the assessment design, and professional influences, which are those factors that the educators themselves bring to the process. A range of activities or tasks were undertaken, including those which were essential to all assessment design; those more selective activities, which educators chose to optimise the assessment process in particular ways; and meta-design processes which educators used to dynamically respond to environmental influences. The qualitative description indicates the complex social nature of interwoven personal and environmental influences on assessment design and the value of an explicit and strategic ways of thinking within the constraints and affordances of a local environment. This suggests that focussing on relational forms of professional development that develop strategic approaches to assessment may be beneficial. The role of disciplinary approaches may be significant and remains an area for future research.},

Understanding how stress affects students in their professional healthcare program warrants exploration. This study assessed stress among dental hygiene students in two educational settings in the Southeastern United States. MethodsFirst and second-year dental hygiene students (N = 136) from a community college setting (n = 67) and a university setting (n = 69) were invited to complete an anonymous online survey on mental health in fall 2019. Validated surveys on depression, anxiety, social support, and burnout were included. Data analysis included chi-squared and Mantel-Haenszel statistics, depending on the scale of measurement, with the level of significance set at 0.05 for all analyses. ResultsParticipants included 54 dental hygiene students from a community college (Response rate = 80.6\%) and 69 dental hygiene students from a university (RR = 100\%). There was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of students reporting moderately severe or severe anxiety (p = 0.007), with 56\% (n = 30) of the community college respondents and 36\% (n = 24) of the university reporting these anxiety levels. Students attending a community college were also more likely to express feelings of worry (n = 34) compared to students in a university setting (p = 0.005). There was no statistically significant difference in depression (p = 0.07) or suicidal thoughts (p = 0.41). ConclusionDental hygiene students enrolled in these two programs reported high levels of self-reported stress, mental and emotional concerns that may increase suicidal tendencies.},

  abstract = {Following the pioneering work of Randy Garrison and colleagues, online teachers in the US and internationally see their discussion boards as communities of inquiry (CoI) which promote sustained communication and higher-level learning. The CoI approach to online discussions is based on John Dewey's conception of education in which teachers and learners are participants in activities working towards a common goal. Teachers in CoI have three main roles: discussion design and organization, discourse facilitation, and direct instruction. Issues have arisen in research on CoI concerning the effectiveness of each role, of communities of inquiry themselves, and of online discussions generally in promoting sustained communication and higher-level learning. The author argues that there is a more fundamental issue at stake; namely, that as currently conceived and practiced, CoI are only loosely based on Dewey's analysis of the concept of education. Furthermore, he demonstrates with examples from his own research how "new modes of practice" based more firmly on Dewey's "new order of conceptions" can help CoI achieve their goals.},

The overarching theme is score validity. Given the increasingly ambitious goals of twenty-first-century assessments, it is important to approach their design in a systematic fashion to ensure that the scores that will eventually be reported are valid. The evidence-centered design (ECD) framework is especially well-suited for the task because it pays special attention to characterizing the evidence in performances. We focus on the evidence identification component of an assessment design within this approach, which identifies and implements procedures for extracting evidence of the proficiencies an assessment claims to support. We illustrate key design decisions in a wide range of domains from writing assessment to games and simulations.},

Using a `scholarship of application' the article begins with an explanation of the literature review and then the element of novelty or necessity of a new idea. It then turns to the six elements of research and writing in terms of theory, themes and narrative as the first three and then the last three: the requirement for description, analysis and evaluation.

It was found that there is some disagreement in the community about the virtues of take-home exams but also a lot of agreement. It is concluded that take-home exams may be the preferred choice of assessment method on the higher taxonomy levels because they promote higher-order thinking skills and allow time for reflection. They are also more consonant with constructive alignment theories and turn the assessment into a learning activity. Due to the obvious risk of unethical student behavior, take-home exams are not recommended on the lowest taxonomy level. It is concluded that there is still a lot of research missing concerning take-home exams in higher education and some of this research may be urgent due to the emergence of massive online open courses (MOOCs) and online universities where non-proctored exams prevail.},

This paper reports on the experience of designing technology-supported assessment based on interviews with 33 Australian university teachers. The findings reveal the desire to achieve greater efficiencies and to be contemporary and innovative as key drivers of technology adoption for assessment. Participants sought to shape student behaviours through their designs and made adaptations in response to positive feedback and undesirable outcomes. Many designs required modification because of a lack of appropriate support, leading to compromise and, in some cases, abandonment. These findings highlight the challenges to effective technology-supported assessment design and demonstrate the difficulties university teachers face when attempting to negotiate mixed messages within institutions and the demands of design work. We use these findings to suggest opportunities to improve support by offering pedagogical guidance and technical help at critical stages of the design process and encouraging an iterative approach to design.

The effectiveness of automated essay scoring (AES) is thus holding a strong appeal to universities for managing an increasing learning interest and reducing costs associated with human raters. The growth in e-learning systems in the higher education system and the demand for consistent writing assessments has spurred research interest in improving the accuracy of AES systems. This paper presents a transformer-based neural network model for improved AES performance using Bi-LSTM and RoBERTa language model based on Kaggle's ASAP dataset. The proposed model uses Bi-LSTM model over pre-trained RoBERTa language model to address the coherency issue in essays that is ignored by traditional essay scoring methods, including traditional NLP pipelines, deep learning-based methods, a mixture of both. The comparison of the experimental results on essay scoring with human raters concludes that the proposed model outperforms the existing methods in essay scoring in terms of QWK score. The comparative analysis of results demonstrates the applicability of the proposed model in automated essay scoring at higher education level.},

  abstract = {There is growing interest in how various technical tools can be used to leverage the instructional process for both teaching and learning. Digital badges are a visual representation of learning and skills. Digital badges have been used as a way to reduce gaps in knowledge (Bowen and Thomas Change, 46(1), 21-25, 2014; Guskey Journal of Advanced Academics, 19(1), 8-31, 2007), increase engagement (Abramovich et al. Educational Technology Research and Development, 61, 217-232, 2013; Glover and Latif 2013), and develop mastery in key concepts (Academic Medicine, 88(10), 1418-1423, 2013). One challenge for educators in using digital badge systems is in how to provide detailed and specific assessment and feedback to students. A potential solution is to pair digital badges with Mastery Learning strategies. In order to examine the types and ways in which instructors provide feedback, individual instructor case studies were developed. Each case was investigated and analyzed holistically as a single entity representing the distinct evaluation style of that instructor. The coding schema used a deductive process based on feedback and Mastery Learning research including the functions of feedback (e.g. task, cognitive, and functional validity information) (Balzer et al. Psychological Bulletin, 106(3), 410, 1989; Butler and Winne Review of Educational Research, 65(3), 245-281, 1995), principles of feedback (e.g. principles supporting self-regulated learning) (Nicol \& Macfarlane-Dick Studies in Higher Education, 31(2), 199-218, 2006), framework of effective feedback (e.g. content, social and interpersonal negotiation, organization and management) (Yang and Carless Teaching in Higher Education, 18(3), 285-297, 2013), and essential elements of Mastery Learning (e.g. feedback, correctives, enrichment) (Guskey Journal of Advanced Academics, 19(1), 8-31, 2007). Instructors' feedback fell within six categories: 1) Outcome Feedback; 2) Clarification; 3) Decreasing Gaps in Knowledge; 4) Motivation and Interaction; 5) Opportunities to Further Knowledge; 6) Promotes Overall Learning and Cognitive Development. Based on the results, specific categories of feedback are discussed.},

More than 600 students participate in over 40 different exams during the summer term. At the end of the spring term, the college moved to fully remote operation due to COVID-19, leaving the academic community with the challenge of delivering examinations remotely. At the time the pandemic hit the UK, teaching for all modules in the department had been completed, the exam timetable had already been published, and all exam papers passed the mandatory external quality review. To implement time-limited remote exams as stipulated by the university, the department decided to proceed with an existing VLE platform for submission of answer-sheets. This study highlights stakeholder reflections from the academic and student community during the implementation of this approach culminating in a mock examination to gauge readiness of the infrastructure as well as the student population. Our survey found that the majority of students ({$>$}80\%) managed to follow the written instructions and readily engaged with scanning technologies and the uploading process. In the main, students did not have to adapt their learning or writing style. All stakeholders provided constructive suggestions at the end of the mock exam resulting in a relatively smooth transition to this new mode of examination. This study highlights challenges and reflections on making the summer year end exams remote in a very short time frame in a large and diverse Chemical Engineering department at very short notice.},

The following themes emerged: (1) inferencing, (2) producing, (3) developing, (4) evaluating, (5) summarising, (6) organising and (7) supporting. A reliability analysis using the Kappa statistic indicated that there is a good degree of agreement among coders, rendering the coding scheme reliable. To demonstrate its utility, the coding scheme was applied to detect differences in the levels of interactions among university students with different backgrounds attending two degree programmes. Implications for the application of the coding scheme in further research are offered, such as comparing the processes activated by different online tools.},

The revised instrument assesses deep and surface approaches only, using fewer items. Method. A set of 43 items was drawn up for the initial tests. These were derived from: the original version of the SPQ, modified items from the SPQ, and new items. A process of testing and refinement eventuated in deep and surface motive and strategy scales each with 5 items, 10 items per approach score. The final version was tested using reliability procedures and confirmatory factor analysis. Sample. The sample for the testing and refinement process consisted of 229 students from the health sciences faculty of a university in Hong Kong. A fresh sample of 495 undergraduate students from a variety of departments of the same university was used for the test of the final version. Results. The final version of the questionnaire had acceptable Cronbach alpha values for scale reliability. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated a good fit to the intended two-factor structure. Both deep and surface approach scales had well identified motive and strategy subscales. Conclusion. The revision process has resulted in a simple questionnaire which teachers can use to evaluate their own teaching and the learning approaches of their students.},

As music is seen as a `hands on' discipline, there has been a very gradual move toward the use of online technologies in music teaching in tertiary education, especially in the area of performance studies. By surveying existing scholarly research, this article investigates the technology available to consider the possibility of teaching performance studies within a fully online environment. Today, music students are also required to develop meta-skills such as social networking, entrepreneurism, self-management, self-regulation, and self-reflection. Through a constructivist teaching and learning paradigm, this article explores how online technology in instrumental or performance studies can support and develop these essential proficiencies as well as continuing to develop technical skills. This study serves as a foundation for further systematic research, and a practical application for online music education.

The analysis is used to relate formative assessment both to other pedagogic initiatives, notably cognitive acceleration and dynamic assessment, and to some of the existing literature on models of self-regulated learning and on classroom discourse. This framework should indicate potentially fruitful lines for further enquiry, whilst at the same time opening up new ways of helping teachers to implement formative practices more effectively.},

  abstract = {"Student voice" (SV) refers to listening to and valuing students' views regarding their learning experiences, as well as treating them as equal partners in the evaluation process. This is expected, in turn, to empower students to take a more active role in shaping their learning. This study explores the role played by digital technologies in creating a space for SV in academia. The qualitative study was conducted in an academic course, which combines face-to face, synchronous lessons with a variety of asynchronous self-directed and group learning activities. The participants were 54 Master's students in education. We analyzed the pedagogical design of the course, as well as interpretations of teaching, learning, assessment, and the role of technology as experienced and presented by the students. The findings demonstrated that students functioned as co-designers of the course content, co-creators of teaching and of their own learning experience. Students perceived the requirements of active learning, teamwork, and community participation (i.e., an advanced way of conveying SV---leadership; Mitra International handbook of student experience in elementary and secondary school, Springer Publishers, The Netherlands, 2007), as both challenges related to overload and stress, and benefits related to the gains of meaningful learning, innovative pedagogical design, and diverse instructional methods. The equalization effect of the digital environment, which diminishes status cues changed the power dynamic, promoted students' active participation and their pedagogical partnership with the instructor. Based on the findings, our conceptualization of SV and its implications for academia includes: (1) co-design of content, (2) co-teaching, (3) co-creation of learning experience and outcomes, and (4) embedded co-assessment for learning.},

Twenty-four items were designed using the concepts of academic integrity; honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility, and courage validated by six raters and tested on 520 students from various universities in Indonesia. Testing content validity using the Aiken-V formula, construct validity testing using discriminant indexes, factor analysis (Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis), and concurrent validity testing by correlating PAAIS-24 with the developed Academic Integrity Scale. While the reliability test used Cronbach's alpha formula. The study results proved that each item of content validity meets with an Aiken value {$>$}0.80; on construct validity testing, the discriminant index value is {$>$}0.50, and the EFA and CFA loading factor values are {$>$}0.50. In addition, the model is appropriate because the theoretical model of PAAIS-24 is in accordance with empirical data. Whereas in reliability testing, Cronbach's alpha value is 0.95. Lastly, PAAIS-24 is one of the credible instruments. It contributes to developing knowledge that assists lecturers in measuring, assessing, and evaluating student academic integrity based on peer-assessment to promote increased academic performance.~Doi: 10.28991/ESJ-2024-08-02-09 Full Text: PDF},

That is, the basic task in education is to find strategies which will take individual differences into consideration but in such a way as to promote the fullest development of the individual. The thesis of this paper is that, to promote mastery learning, 5 variables must be dealt with effectively: (1) aptitude for kinds of learning, viewed as the amount of time required by the learner to attain mastery of the task; (2) quality of instruction, viewed in terms of its approaching the optimum for a given learner; (3) ability to understand instruction, i.e., to understand the nature of the task and the procedures to follow; (4) perseverance, the amount of time one is willing to spend in learning; and (5) time allowed for learning, the key to mastery.

Assessment is a crucial part of education, especially in STEM fields. A gap analysis was performed by expert groups in the frame of an Erasmus+ project looking at the practices of six European countries. Specialists teaching university-grade mathematics in seven European institutions were asked about their perception of gaps in the assessment of students both before (2019) and during (2021) the pandemic. This qualitative study looks at the difference in perception of such gaps after almost one year of online teaching. The analysis of their responses showed that some gaps were present before the pandemic, as well as others that are specific to it. Some gaps, such as the lack of IT infrastructure and the need to adapt materials to an online environment, have been exacerbated by the outbreak.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT           Despite an increasingly diverse population, an unmet demand for undergraduates from underrepresented racial and ethnic minority (URM) backgrounds exists in the field of medicine as a result of financial hurdles and insufficient educational support faced by URM students in the premedical journey. With the capacity to provide highly individualized and accessible no- or low-cost dynamic instruction, large language models (LLMs) and their chatbot derivatives are posed to change this dynamic and subsequently help shape a more diverse future physician workforce. While studies have established the passing performance and insightful explanations of one of the most accurate LLM-powered chatbots to date---Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT)---on standardized exams such as medical licensing exams, the role of ChatGPT in premedical education remains unknown. We evaluated the performance of ChatGPT on the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT), a standardized 230-question multiple choice exam that assesses a broad range of competencies in the natural, physical, social, and behavioral sciences as well as critical analysis and reasoning. Depending on its visual item response strategy, ChatGPT performed at or above the median performance of 276,779 student test takers on the MCAT. Additionally, ChatGPT-generated answers demonstrated both a high level of agreement with the official answer key as well as insight into its explanations. Based on these promising results, we anticipate two primary applications of ChatGPT and future LLM iterations in premedical education: firstly, such models could provide free or low-cost access to personalized and insightful explanations of MCAT competency-related questions to help students from all socioeconomic and URM backgrounds. Secondly, these models could be used to generate additional test questions by test-makers or for targeted preparation by pre-medical students. These applications of ChatGPT in premedical education could be an invaluable, innovative path forward to increase diversity and improve equity among premedical students.},

  abstract = {Although the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) has a substantial history as a research domain, never before has the rapid evolution of AI applications in education sparked such prominent public discourse. Given the growing AIEd literature base in higher education, it is important to ensure that the field has a solid research and conceptual grounding as AI adoption increases. This review of reviews is the first comprehensive meta review to explore the scope and nature of AIEd in higher education (AIHEd) research, by synthesising secondary research (e.g., systematic reviews), indexed in the Web of Science, Scopus, ERIC, EBSCOHost, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect and ACM Digital Library, or captured through snowballing in OpenAlex, ResearchGate and Google Scholar. Reviews were included if they synthesised applications of AI solely in formal higher or continuing education, were published in English between 2018 and July 2023, were journal articles or full conference papers, and if they had a method section. 66 publications were included for data extraction and synthesis in EPPI Reviewer, which were predominantly systematic reviews (66.7\%), published by authors from North America (27.3\%), conducted in teams (89.4\%) in mostly domestic-only collaborations (71.2\%). Findings show that these reviews mostly focused on AIHEd generally (47.0\%) or Profiling and Prediction (28.8\%) as thematic foci, however key findings indicated a predominance of the use of Adaptive Systems and Personalisation in higher education. Research gaps identified suggest a need for greater ethical, methodological, and contextual considerations within future research, alongside interdisciplinary approaches to AIHEd application. Suggestions are provided to guide future primary and secondary research.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to test the need in the Australian higher education (HE) sector for a national network for the peer review of assessment in response to the proposed HE standards framework and propose a sector-wide framework for calibrating and assuring achievement standards, both within and across disciplines, through the establishment of a peer review of assessment network (PRAN). Design/methodology/approach: This study used a "proof of concept" approach to test the need for a national network, using consultations (n = 67) which included teleconference meetings [39], face-to-face meetings [2], Skype [1], presentations [19], state-based workshops [6] and a national forum. Quantitative data from evaluation surveys from state-based workshops and national forum were computer-analysed to generate descriptive statistics. Qualitative data arising from open-ended questionnaire responses were analysed through progressive categorisation and data coding designed to identify and refine data themes. Findings: In all, 63 per cent of participants to the state-based workshops were satisfied with the workshop content. A further 29 per cent reported a high level of satisfaction. The interactive group discussions fostered a collaborative approach and facilitated engagement with the workshop content. A total of 58 per cent of participants to the national forum were satisfied with the forum, with a further 40 per cent reporting a high level of satisfaction. Participants indicated that presentation content was informative and covered a diverse range of topics and viewpoints highly relevant to the current clime across the HE sector. Practical implications: Many participants strongly supported the establishment of a national PRAN, with overwhelming support (88 per cent) for the forum to be made an annual event. Originality/value: This study contributes to existing literature and provides further evidence for the value of networks in the peer review of assessment to support academics in professional learning and calibration exercises.},

  abstract = {Metacognition can be considered as knowledge about one's own cognitive activities and their regulation during learning processes (Flavell, 1979). Students are, then, involved in metacognitive mental activities when they think about what they have learned, how they have learned it, or how they can relate it to their personal experiences, among other things. Based on this, students who develop these skills should show more appropriate strategies to know what they need to find out or do while learning. Therefore, understanding and controlling these cognitive processes may be one of the most essential skills that teachers should encourage at all academic levels (Anderson, 2002). The Guided Learning Diary (GLD, Bort-Mir, 2016) was developed as a learning diary with several aims: (i) defining the general and specific objectives of the content to be taught, (ii) developing the students' metacognitive skills through strategic questions, and (iii) promoting the development of important competences such as self-criticism, autonomous learning, self-evaluation and capacity for improvement. The GLD also allows a self-evaluation process for teachers, thus facilitating the supervision and improvement both of the contents of the course and the didactic methodology. This tool was developed and applied within the Theatre in English subject at Universitat Jaume I, embedded in the third course of the English Studies Degree, and the students' results were significantly higher than those of previous years (Bort-Mir \& Silvestre-L{\'o}pez, 2017). The present research proposes a technological turn in the application of the GLD with the use of the open-source tool Penzu™. The creation of academic online diaries with this tool may improve students' motivation while promoting meaningful and self-regulated learning in Higher Education environments, thus helping students reach academic success. Penzu™ allows this investigation to widen the scope of the GLD to the general public.},

Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, refer to AI that is designed to create or generate new content, such as text, images, or music, from their trained parameters. With free access online and an easy-to-use conversational interface, ChatGPT quickly accumulated more than 100 million users within the first few months of its launch. Recent headlines in the popular press have ignited concerns relevant to medical education over the possible implications of cheating and plagiarism in assessments as well as excitement over new opportunities for learning, assessment, and research. In this Scholarly Perspective, the authors offer insights and recommendations about generative AI for medical educators based on literature review, including the AI literacy framework. The authors provide a definition of generative AI, introduce an AI literacy framework and competencies, and offer considerations for potential impacts and opportunities to optimize integration of generative AI for admissions, learning, assessment, and medical education research to help medical educators navigate and start planning for this new environment. As generative AI tools continue to expand, educators need to increase their AI literacy through education and vigilance around new advances in the technology and serve as stewards of AI literacy to foster social responsibility and ethical awareness around the use of AI.},

The participants were 396 first-year university psychology students attending a mandatory course on biological psychology. During the course, student attendance to face-to-face lectures was registered and the viewing of the recordings monitored. Results revealed that a large amount of students used the recorded lectures as a substitute for lecture attendance. The group who uses recorded lectures as a supplement when developing a knowledge base score significantly higher on the assessment. When assessing higher order thinking skills, no significant differences were found between using recording lectures and attending lectures. This can be partly explained by relatively low predictive value either form of lectures have on exam performance.},

  abstract = {ENGLISH Can we be sure that assessment in higher education meets the need of developing and assuring high quality learning outcomes? Current assessment is typically a collection of conventional practices that have never been seriously questioned. Ten years ago, as part of a national project, representatives from Australian universities came together to identify an agenda for change in assessment. The resulting document---Assessment 2020: Seven propositions for assessment reform in higher education---focused on how assessment needed to change to support long term learning. That is, not how students can pass the next exam, but learning that is useful beyond the point of graduation. From a learning-centred view this paper examine progress on assessment reform in universities internationally from the perspective of one of the players. It starts by considering Assessment 2020 to see where action is still needed. It reviews some of the major shifts in assessment in higher education and considers their implications. These include the move from comparing students (norm-referencing) to judging outcomes against standards (standards-based); and importantly, the conceptual shift from the single purpose of assessment as certifying students to multiple purposes including aiding learning and building the capacity of students to make their own judgements.

Es decir, no se trata de c{\'o}mo los estudiantes pueden aprobar el pr{\'o}ximo examen, sino de que aprendan lo que ser{\'a} {\'u}til m{\'a}s all{\'a} del momento de la graduaci{\'o}n.  Desde una perspectiva centrada en el aprendizaje, este documento analiza a nivel internacional el progreso que se ha producido en las universidades en torno a la reforma de la evaluaci{\'o}n desde la perspectiva de uno de sus actores. Se inicia considerando el documento Evaluaci{\'o}n 2020 para ver d{\'o}nde a{\'u}n se necesitan acciones. Se revisa algunos de los principales cambios en la evaluaci{\'o}n en la educaci{\'o}n superior y sus implicaciones. Estos incluyen el tr{\'a}nsito de comparar estudiantes (evaluaci{\'o}n referida a normas) a juzgar resultados contra est{\'a}ndares (evaluaci{\'o}n basada en est{\'a}ndares) y, lo que es m{\'a}s importante, el cambio conceptual de pasar de un prop{\'o}sito simple de la evaluaci{\'o}n, como es el de certificar a los estudiantes, a considerar m{\'u}ltiples prop{\'o}sitos, incluyendo ayudar al aprendizaje y al desarrollo de la capacidad de los estudiantes para emitir sus propios juicios.},

  abstract = {Peer evaluation consists of the evaluation of students by their peers following criteria or rubrics provided by the teacher, where the way to evaluate students is specified so that they achieve the desired competencies. The quality of the measurement instrument must meet two essential criteria: validity and reliability. In this research, we explored the educational value of peer evaluation rubrics by analyzing the quality of the rubric through the study of content validity, reliability, and internal consistency. Our main purpose was to design an appropriate rubric to grade tasks in the field of information engineering, as well as performing content validation through a group of experts. It was carried out in three phases: 1) construction of a rubric, with its criteria, characteristics, and levels of achievement; 2) content validation by five experts in the field, and 3) application of the rubric to ascertain students' perceptions and satisfaction with its validity. The relevance of the criteria and the definition of their characteristics obtained a score higher than 3.75/4 on a Likert scale. The content validity values (CVR), content validity index (CVI), and general content validity index (GIVC) gave maximum values of\,+\,1. The results obtained indicate that the rubric is adequate, with Aiken's V higher than V 0.87 in all its criteria. The rubric was applied to 326 students of 4 subjects. Cronbach's alpha was used to calculate the reliability of the rubric, obtaining a value of 0.839. The students' perception of validity and satisfaction with the rubric was higher than 0.78. As future work, we intend to design a rubric validation engine according to the applied procedure.},

However, the literature to date makes little reference to the variation that exists within the models and frameworks as far as their scope, context, epistemological and pedagogical underpinnings and so on. In this paper, we critically contrast models of technology-enhanced learning design in order to support educator selection of models, as well as to derive an overarching understanding of how learning design models may differ ontologically. A total of 21 models were selected from a systematic search of the technology-enhanced learning design research literature. Findings indicated that technology-enhanced learning design models can be differentiated according to whether they constitute a conceptual framework or a procedural method, their epistemological and pedagogical underpinnings, the level of granularity of the model, the extent to which contextual elements are considered, whether interactions between teachers and students are integral, whether guidance for selecting technologies is included and whether any sort of evaluation of the model has been conducted. The utility of each of these dimensions in terms of supporting technology-enhanced learning design is considered, and the value more broadly of learning design models is critically discussed.},

  abstract = {Educators and researchers worldwide are confronted by a tantalizing challenge - how should contemporary technologies be used to enhance learning? This book provides a broad academic and teaching audience with an integrated understanding of learning technology research, and how it can be used to enhance the design of learning environments. Whereas some books focus exclusively on research relating to learning technology and others propose ways to use technology effectively, this book synthesises research for the purpose of informing best practice. After laying pedagogical, technological and content foundations, it examines research relating to the educational use of Web 2.0, social networking, mobile devices and virtual worlds. Analysis across these contexts leaves readers with a nuanced understanding of how technology-enhanced learning design principles may (or may not) be abstracted across different learning technology environments. Providing an integrated portrayal of learning technology research enables educators (academics, school teachers, pre-service teachers and educational designers) to immediately adopt evidence-based approaches in their teaching. The comprehensive synthesis of the literature also helps learning technology researchers to more clearly identify the interrelationships between different areas of learning technology research, as well as position their work amongst the practical problems of the field. Rich with examples, this book is suitable for those who want to adopt a design-based and research-driven approach to enhancing learning using technology.},

The three key findings of the study were that: i) the facility to practice lead to a significant improvement in test score ii) providing students with their non-preferred form of feedback had a significantly negative impact on their mathematics ability self-rating iii) boys appeared more likely to adopt a fixated approach to this "power based" repetitive practise task. The differential effect of competitive versus individualistic feedback was also analysed.},

They are often conducted in large indoor environments that can accommodate high numbers of students to maximize scheduling and cost efficiency. Recent evidence, however, suggests enlarged room scale impacts brain activity that is associated with concentration, which could negatively impact cognitive performance. We analysed data (N~=~15,400) from undergraduate students over eight years across three campuses at an Australian tertiary institution. Using a linear mixed model, we compared examination performance across different room scales, while accounting for coursework performance, and other variables. We found student examination performance was reduced in rooms with elevated ceiling heights. These results support the notion that built environment scale influences cognitive performance, and argue against conducting examinations in large scale, high-ceiling rooms.},

A wide range of technologies (including video conferencing, web conferencing and virtual worlds), tasks (namely collaborative evaluation, group questioning, class discussion, problem solving and collaborative design) and levels of student interaction (from lightweight to tightly coupled) were present within the designs. The main issues that teachers confronted when facilitating blended synchronous lessons were those relating to communication and those relating to cognitive overload caused by split attention. Key pedagogical principles for enactment as identified by the lead teachers included the need for extensive preparation, clear instructions, composure, flexibility, advance preparation of students and savvy utilisation of support staff.},

The Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic hit hard and interrupted many dimensions of our lives, particularly education. As a response to interruption of education due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this study is a collaborative reaction that narrates the overall view, reflections from the K-12 and higher educational landscape, lessons learned and suggestions from a total of 31 countries across the world with a representation of 62,7\% of the whole world population. In addition to the value of each case by country, the synthesis of this research suggests that the current practices can be defined as emergency remote education and this practice is different from planned practices such as distance education, online learning or other derivations. Above all, this study points out how social injustice, inequity and the digital divide have been exacerbated during the pandemic and need unique and targeted measures if they are to be addressed. While there are support communities and mechanisms, parents are overburdened between regular daily/professional duties and emerging educational roles, and all parties are experiencing trauma, psychological pressure and anxiety to various degrees, which necessitates a pedagogy of care, affection and empathy. In terms of educational processes, the interruption of education signifies the importance of openness in education and highlights issues that should be taken into consideration such as using alternative assessment and evaluation methods as well as concerns about surveillance, ethics, and data privacy resulting from nearly exclusive dependency on online solutions.},

This paper intends to explore the promises and pitfalls of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) AI and potentially future technologies by adopting a speculative methodology. Speculative future narratives with a specific focus on educational contexts are provided in an attempt to identify emerging themes and discuss their implications for education in the 21st century. Affordances of (using) AI in Education (AIEd) and possible adverse effects are identified and discussed which emerge from the narratives. It is argued that now is the best of times to define human vs AI contribution to education because AI can accomplish more and more educational activities that used to be the prerogative of human educators. Therefore, it is imperative to rethink the respective roles of technology and human educators in education with a future-oriented mindset.},

When coupled with careful assessment design principles, DCMs hold promise for reliably estimating high dimensionality under feasible testing conditions in order to provide a multivariate view of a student's knowledge that is aligned with cognitive theory. This chapter presents the DCM framework using log-linear cognitive diagnosis model parameterizations and then illustrates how DCMs can support the functionality of assessments as a research tool for refining cognitive theories as well as an educational tool for describing diverse student reasoning and knowledge profiles. Finally, the chapter discusses considerations researchers and practitioners make when using DCMs.},

Objective testing, specifically multiple-choice questions (MCQ's) are one of the approaches that may diversify the assessment approach in Irish undergraduate nursing education. In this paper, Quinn's [Quinn, F.M., 2000. The Principles and Practice of Nurse Education, fourth ed., Stanley Thorne (Publishers) Ltd, Cheltenham] cardinal criteria of assessment, practicality, reliability, validity and discrimination provide a useful framework to discuss the issues associated with the implementation of this type of assessment strategy. MCQ examinations that are consistent with educational outcomes can be used to effectively assess aspects of student performance and can facilitate timely feedback and contribute to the process of self-learning. Significant commitment is required to prepare MCQ test items and examination formats that are reliable and consistent with curriculum objectives. Appropriately constructed MCQ examinations are efficient, objective, capable of discrimination and can be combined with other assessment strategies to contribute to a comprehensive student assessment strategy for use in nursing education.},

This paper is a qualitative synthesis of 65 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2012 and 2017 reporting on the use of technology for assessment (TfA). The results suggest that there are some efficiencies for staff in implementing TfA but this can come with a cost at the set-up and maintenance phases. Furthermore, results indicated that assessment design is not of foremost concern to academic staff when introducing TfA, but that a wide variety of pressures and both educational and operational drivers are present. There were inconclusive findings in relation to understandings of appropriate institutional environments and supports for TfA to flourish in higher education. There is a need for empirical research, particularly longitudinal investigations, of academic experiences of implementations of TfA to investigate sustainability of adoption. The imperative of exploring the academic staff perspective as the instigator and manager of both the technology and the student learning experience requires deep consideration as TfA adoption progresses.},

I argue that such interactive devices can be seen as archives of future communication. As a media archaeologist working with electronic toys I often find the conceptualizations of these devices as mere tools for playing unsatisfactory. They seem to share more characteristics with archives than with instruments. Like archives, interactive toys hold in themselves a predefined choice of informations and interactions, thus enabling certain modes of inquiry and discouraging others. Especially the electronic toys that draw on algorithms and data to present the user with an imitation of human communication are able to offer branching paths of interlocution within their domain or topic. In the first part of this article I offer an explanation of the toy's technical structures that store speech and spelling data and enforce certain patterns of input and output between the device and its user. Then, I propose the use of the notion of the archive, or, alternatively, anarchive to describe the space of possibilities that defines this process of communication. In the last part I argue that the study of such algorithmic archives of possible communication needs to be based on interactive experimentation and can not be grounded in static recordings or descriptions alone.},

A concern is that the high-stakes purpose may lead to distortions in the inferences about students and teachers that SLOs can support. This concern is explored in the present study by contrasting student SLO scores in a large urban school district to performance on a common objective external criterion. This external criterion is used to evaluate the extent to which student growth scores appear to be inflated. Using 2 years of data, growth comparisons are also made at the teacher level for teachers who submit SLOs and have students that take the state-administered large-scale assessment. Although they do show similar relationships with demographic covariates and have the same degree of stability across years, the two different measures of growth are weakly correlated.},

However, the Standards have become a bit dated, most notably in two ways: (1) the Standards do not consider current conceptions of formative assessment knowledge and skills, and (2) the Standards do not consider teacher knowledge and skills required to successfully work in the current accountability and ``standards-based reform'' context. This article briefly reviews the 1990 Standards and their influence, describes some other lists of assessment knowledge and skills that might be considered in updating them, and then proposes educational assessment knowledge and skills for teachers that reflect current teacher assessment needs. This set of competencies should help focus the work of teachers, teacher supervisors, professional developers, teacher educators, and others responsible for teachers' assessment knowledge and skills.},

At the 2019 Learning Sciences International's National Formative Assessment Conference, the four of us participated in a panel session to explore the place of grading as an important component of comprehensive and balanced district assessment systems. After this panel discussion, we met to summarize our discussion and make recommendations for how grading might be improved to enhance student learning, supporting our points with research and our practical experiences. Here are some of our thoughts on needed improvements.1},

The review draws conclusions about the meaning of graded achievement, its relation to tested achievement, and changes in the construct of graded achievement over time. Graded achievement reflects students' broad accomplishment of classroom and school learning goals, including goals about how to learn. Both high school and elementary grades contain information about school achievement that includes being socialized into the way learning happens in classrooms. Graded achievement reflects specific course learning goals and therefore varies according to subject; academic course grades align more closely with tested achievement than noncore course grades. Graded achievement also reflects individual teachers' grading practices and emphases about what is important to learn. Report card grades can be reliable and valid measures of graded achievement, but may not be depending on individual teachers' grading practices.}

The reliability of essay scoring is highly problematic and it appears that essay examination grades are highly dependent on language and organisational components of writing. Computer-assisted scoring of essays makes use of language features and has demonstrated strong similarity to human ratings. Studies of examiner behaviour show that attention to content and language features contributes to grading decisions. However, given the time constraints on essay examinations, an overemphasis on language aspects may weaken the validity of essay examination grades. This article suggests alternative approaches to the standard essay prompt which should raise the validity of essay tasks and scoring in higher education. Suggested options include redesigning tasks so that organisational and language features are less influential in scoring and the use of content maps.},

Item difficulty, discrimination, and chance properties were determined using Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory statistical item analysis models. The two-parameter logistic model consistently had the best fit to the data. The impact on overall course grades between the original raw score model and the IRT 2PL model showed 70\% of students would receive the same grade (i.e., D to A), but only one-third would get the same mark using the standard augmented grade scale (i.e., A+ to D-).

Addressing issues of dissonance within the higher education learning sphere requires re-imagining the educational culture. Re-imagining provides an opportunity to promote new approaches to learning through alternative affordances; one such affordance is technology mediated learning. Pedagogical re-design within an alternative learning paradigm requires deep understanding of the problems associated with the previous paradigm. Re-imagined pedagogical scope for exploration of the professional, learning, cultural, institutional and technical aspects expand the knowledge base beyond the didactic towards an engaging student-centered ethos using open education and gamification. To address issues of learning, culture, technology, and institution, a convergent mixed methods design using student questionnaires and academic interviews alongside performance observations was employed. The research study examined the re-imagining of the educational culture to promote new approaches to learning through the affordances of technology mediated learning within a constructivist, critical realism epistemology using thematic analysis. The re-imagined pedagogical design within a technology mediated learning environment demonstrates a cultural shift towards an engaging and supportive educational experience.

In this perspective piece, I describe two major risks if that future were to be embraced; that is, lack of equitable access and dehumanization. My argument is that these futures already exist in pockets around the globe and we can use those experiences to evaluate those options.

The reliability of essay scoring is highly problematic and it appears that essay examination grades are highly dependent on language and organisational components of writing. Computer-assisted scoring of essays makes use of language features and has demonstrated strong similarity to human ratings. Studies of examiner behaviour show that attention to content and language features contributes to grading decisions. However, given the time constraints on essay examinations, an overemphasis on language aspects may weaken the validity of essay examination grades. This article suggests alternative approaches to the standard essay prompt which should raise the validity of essay tasks and scoring in higher education.

Online, open education programmes have considerable potential to provide flexible access to education for refugees, who are not well represented within higher education. As part of a wider University of Sanctuary initiative, interview data from six Ireland-based refugees was analysed using a data-led, qualitative methodological framework grounded in discursive psychology. Findings indicate that participants' transition narratives are typical in many ways as they form student identities while managing their existing identities and begin to feel, or not, that they belong. Participants constructed a stark divide between two duelling identities, between their identity as a refugee and their new identity as an online learner. Identification with the university was emphasised in contrast to disidentification with the 'asylum world'. These findings indicate that a strategically connected approach to supporting refugees transition into higher education can impact positively on these students.},

This article reviews recent literature in order to assess the role played by the approaches adopted by researchers in the gap between research on exams, and the way exams are used. Viviane Robinson?s ?problem-based methodology? focuses on the need for researchers to engage with the challenges and priorities of practitioners. Drawing on Robinson?s approach, the article investigates how the strengths and weaknesses of exams and their alternatives are framed in the literature published between 2016 and 2021. The article concludes that there is an absence of evidence about how and why practitioners make decisions about assessment. This hinders the ability of assessment researchers to appropriately connect their work with the assessment challenges practitioners face. To make a difference, assessment research needs to live in the real world; a world which, at least as far as practitioners? assessment decisions are concerned, we do not yet sufficiently understand.},

Standard (pen-and-paper) tests offer immediate evidence of success but they put heavy demands on students' cognitive, performance and stress-controlling skills. CALL-related techniques can be used as supplementary ones, even if technically assessing different sub-skills, "Kahoot" or "Moodle" quizzes can complement and re-orientate the assessment as well as the learning processes. To investigate the impact of the diverse assessment measures a small-scale research was conducted among Year 1 students of the English Department at the Pedagogical University in Krak{\'o}w. They are participants in a 90-hours-a-year pronunciation course, where one of the components involves mastering transcribing skills. The specific element of the course evaluated by standard and CALL-related measures in the study were the phonetic variants of the -es and -ed endings in English. Through analysis of test scores, coupled with the ideas obtained via semi-structured interviews, the study hoped to verify the claim that matters such as student comfort, instant individual feedback and personal safety are most efficiently handled by the "Moodle" quizzes. Apart from providing well-balanced scores, they offer the least-threatening, stress-free environments for learning and assessment, thus developing students' self-monitoring their progress.},

To this effect, this paper focuses on the ways to transform the Traditional driven methods of instructional and administrative delivery which in all ramification inactive. There are barriers hindering wholesome ICT integration in the University of Maiduguri such as inadequate power supply, lack of fund to equip schools, leadership focus and direction. Perhaps when the Universities, Government and stakeholders surmount these barriers, then we can propel to that paperless classroom. The paper further demonstrates how instructional delivery via computer transforms the thinking and impact on learners and general administration of Schools. It reflects on some of the impact and challenges of using CBI, CAI, CBT and recommends an optimum solution to the adaptation and use of the new Technologies to improve learning, evaluation and administrative delivery in the University of Maiduguri, Nigeria.},

  abstract = {The importance of subscores in educational and psychological assessments is undeniable. Subscores yield diagnostic information that can be used for determining how each examinee's abilities/skills vary over different content domains. One of the most common criticisms about reporting and using subscores is insufficient reliability of subscores. This study employs a new reliability approach that allows the evaluation of between-person subscore reliability as well as within-person subscore reliability. Using this approach, the unidimensional IRT (UIRT) and multidimensional IRT (MIRT) models are compared in terms of subscore reliability in simulation and real data studies. Simulation conditions in the simulation study are subtest length, correlations among subscores, and number of subtests. Both unidimensional and multidimensional subscores are estimated with the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) method. Subscore reliability of ability estimates are evaluated in light of between-person reliability, within-person reliability, and total profile reliability. The results of this study suggest that the MIRT model performs better than the UIRT model under all simulation conditions. Multidimensional subscore estimation benefits from correlations among subscores as ancillary information, and it yields more reliable subscore estimates than unidimensional subscore estimation. The subtest length is positively associated with both between-person and within-person reliability. Higher correlations among subscores improve between-person reliability, while they substantially decrease within-person reliability. The number of subtests seems to influence between-person reliability slightly but it has no effect on within-person reliability. The two estimation methods provide similar results with real data as well.},

The availability of ICT at home and at school was positively associated with achievement in Turkey, but not in Finland. Finally, the use of ICT for entertainment was associated positively with achievement in Turkey, but negatively in Finland.

One of these technologies is e-assessment, a form of assessment that enables students to answer items using digital devices, such as computers and tablets. One of the benefits of e-assessments is the ability to generate interactive, timely, and customized feedback for students. Yet, despite vast literature on the generation and delivery of feedback, there is no systematic review of the guidelines on how e-assessments can be used for generating effective feedback. The objectives of this study are threefold. First, we synthesize the literature on the current practices in feedback generation. Second, we provide researchers and practitioners with a synthesis of guidelines for best practices in generating effective feedback with e-assessments. Third, we introduce a new framework in which we demonstrate the six steps of creating an e-assessment that can help produce immediate, customized, and specific feedback for students. This framework combines multiple forms of feedback (e.g., graphs, tables, and text) to improve the understanding of feedback and engage students in the interpretation of their score reports. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.},

With limited institutional and departmental support, the GSIs struggled to transform their face-to-face assessments to leverage technology but leaned on their professional judgment to prioritize traditional discussion and participation structures. Findings inform our understanding of how universities might prioritize professional learning networks on online teaching at differing institutional levels to increase GSIs' access to online teaching information and knowledgeable role models.},

Addressing the scarcity of a collective effort on discussing these limitations, this review paper aims to present a descriptive analysis of the limitations of the Kirkpatrick evaluation model in the higher education field. Three themes of limitations were found out: propensity towards the use of the lower levels of the model; rigidity which leaves out other essential aspects of the evaluand; and paucity of evidence on the causal chains among the levels. It is suggested that, when employing the Kirkpatrick model in higher education, evaluators should address these limitations by considering more appropriate methods, integrating contextual inputs in the evaluation framework, and establishing causal relationships among the levels. These suggestions to address the limitations of the model are discussed at the end of the study.},

As a consequence, changes were evident in the grading component solely focusing on student attendance; grading system shifting to descriptive binary; requirements for laboratory and research works significantly modified; and exclusion of grades earned in the current semester from the computation of grade point average. Drawing lessons from this case study, it is recommended that in reshaping assessment practices in this time, different contexts must be cogently considered, so that reasonable changes will be better understood.},

  abstract = {In the constructivist approach, various self-assessment techniques are being developed to enable students to assess themselves in the learning process. The purpose of the study is to investigate relation between students' preferences in assessment process and students' performances. The study was conducted with 67 sophomore students enrolled in Department of Computer Education and Instructional Technologies at a State University. The study was carried out in ``Measurement and Evaluation in Education'' course. At the beginning, Moodle LMS was used to define the preferences of students about their own assessment criteria (discussion, quiz, assignment and viewing of course content). Throughout the process, students were received the course instructional package in the classroom. Then they were asked to fill the assessment activities on the LMS. Students' actual performances in online activities in terms of their preference about assessment criteria was calculated as students course achievement scores. The mean value of the scores and the standard deviation were guided us to divide the participants into three groups (unsuccessful, moderately successful, successful) considering their means and standard deviations. Then, the preferences of students and their academic achievements were associated in each group. As a result, various criteria were come to front in both successful and unsuccessful groups. Surprisingly, none of the students preferred viewing course content and participating in discussions as the highest assessment criterion. Besides, it was found that all the students in successful group preferred viewing course content as lowest assessment criterion. The results indicated that, there were no prominent criteria in the relations between the preferences of students about assessment process and the academic performances. However, most of the students in unsuccessful group performed better in assignment although they did not preferred the assignment as the highest assessment criterion. At the end of the study, we noticed that while considering the criterion in the assessment process, taking students' perspectives and preferences into consideration motivated students positively and had somehow related to their academic achievements. Thus, it is hoped that the study can provides an insight to future studies to enrich assessment activities with giving responsibilities to students in learning, especially in assessment process.},

Language achievement is influenced by self-assessment (SA), academic resilience (AR), academic motivation (AM), and test-taking skills (T-TS) among other factors. Considering the relevance of these factors in language achievement, the current investigation aims to delve into the probable interactions of SA, AR, AM, T-TS, and test anxiety (TA) management among English as a foreign language (EFL) learners. A model was devised and evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) to achieve this objective. This research collected 512 by distributing online questionnaires to fifteen approved private institutions which applied Telegram-based language learning. The study findings reflected that SA, AR, and AM could predict EFL learners' T-TS. It was also confirmed that SA, AR, and AM modulated EFL learners' TA. The implications of the study are presented and accompanied by some future research proposals as well as instructional consequences.},

However, as far as we know, no tools have been developed to assist in the assessment of the solution process of open-ended questions. In this paper, we propose the use of analysis of traces as a tool to address this need. To illustrate this approach, we developed a modified version of R Commander that collects traces of students' actions and described a way to analyze them by using regular expressions. We used this tool in an undergraduate introductory statistics course. The traces were analyzed by comparing them to predefined problem-solving steps, arranged by the instructor. The analyses provide information about the time students spent on the activity, their work intensity and the choices they made when solving open-ended questions. This automated assessment tool provides grades highly correlated to those obtained by a traditional test and traditional grading scheme.},

Students from a large (n = 325) first-year educational technology course were given the opportunity to use the new ePortfolio system weekly as part of their reflective practice at the end of the hands-on tutorial classes and also through a blogging assignment that required six posts throughout the semester. Although the students reflecting on their work and ePortfolios themselves are not new concepts, this paper reports how assessment practices can be improved using ePortfolios and how students can improve their reflective practice through simple and regular use throughout the 12-week semester that the study was conducted. From the class, 208 students responded to the survey with the results being positive. The students were able to use the system easily and did not report many problems with crashing or freezing. The lessons learnt form an important part of this study for future iterations with these reported in the paper.},

Therefore, 23 pre-service EFL teachers studying at a private university in Santiago were asked to provide their perceptions regarding the Socrative OSRS in terms of its usability, its impact on learning, and its impact on engagement. Findings showed that students held positive perceptions towards the usability of the application, but remained neutral in relation to its impact on learning and engagement.

  abstract = {Classroom assessment is an essential component of the current standards-based education system. However, with the increase in classroom technology and sudden shift to remote learning, educators must alter and adapt their assessment strategies, even if they feel unprepared or uncomfortable doing so. Using teacher assessment identity (Looney et al., 2018) as a conceptual framework, this study explored the assessment practices and evolving assessment identity of educators as they implemented assessment via technology. This study utilized a secondary analysis drawing upon a subset of data collected during a collaborative program evaluation and responded to the following questions: (1) How do teachers leverage assessment via technology in their teaching practice to support the evolution of their classroom assessment conceptualizations and practices? (2) What can be understood about teacher assessment identity as they work to integrate technology in their teaching practice and expand their classroom assessment practices? Data was analyzed using an inductive, deductive, and hybrid approach using a four-phase qualitative analysis procedure (Bengtsson, 2016). Findings from the inductive analysis noted that teachers supported their reconceptualization of assessment through expanded assessment practices, seeking professional development, and developing core competencies for 21st century learners. The deductive analysis highlighted the interconnected nature of the five dimensions of the teachers' assessment identity framework and how these dimensions are informed and influenced by learning, catalyzed through reflection, collaboration, and a commitment to professional development. The findings and implications of this study are discussed in regard to research, practice, and policy to bolster an understanding of assessment, learning, and educational technology.},

From a synthesis of relevant literature, I outline four main AfL strategies: productive assessment task design, effective feedback processes, the development of student understanding of quality and activities where students make judgments. I explore the notion of scaling up in relation to spread, depth, sustainability and shifts in ownership. Then I present a rationale for the scaling up of AfL following from dissatisfaction with current practices and persuasive research evidence on practices congruent with AfL. I relate the notion of scaling up to the geographical spread of AfL research activity, its somewhat modest impact on university assessment policies and in relation to the expansion of feedback research. I then consider what conditions might facilitate deeper and broader implementation of AfL, including the role of quality assurance, the importance of leadership and incentives, the development of assessment literacy through professional development activities and the potential of technology to act as a lever for enabling AfL strategies.},

McMaster Continuing Education is known for its expertise in online education and support of adult learners as they seek professionally focused education. The Real Institute provides dedicated in-class programming and support strategies for younger adult learners. In this chapter, the experiences of older and younger adults from diverse cultural backgrounds studying at the two units are presented. The authors suggest that the needs of this learner group may be better met within the continuing education unit than within the mainstream academy. Innovative learning strategies and flexibility are key elements in this position. Finally, it is suggested that the two profiled units take their duty of care and commitment to student success seriously.},

  abstract = {Fast improvements in computing power and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms enable us to automate important decisions that shape our everyday lives, and drive workplace transformations. It is predicted that many people will find themselves unprepared to deal with high degrees of change and uncertainty, increasingly posed by AI in some sectors. A critical educational challenge involves figuring out how to support young generations to develop the capabilities that they will need to adapt to, and innovate in, a world with AI. This article argues that both educators and learners should be involved not only in learning but also in co-designing for learning in an AI world. Further, they together should explore the knowledge, goals and actions that could help people shape future AI scenarios, and learn to deal with high degrees of uncertainty. A key contribution of the paper is a re-conceptualization of design for learning in an AI world, which explores a problem space of educational design, and illustrates how educators and learners can work together to re-imagine education futures in an AI world. As part of this problem space, the paper discusses underpinning philosophies (the capability approach and value creation), a high-level pedagogy (with an emphasis on co-creation), pedagogical strategies (speculative pedagogies), and pedagogical tactics (AI scenarios). It then proposes a design framework (ACAD) to support educators and learners' discussions about design for learning in an AI world. This participatory design approach aims to sensitize people for what education may mean, for whom, and how learning with AI may look like, and it highlights the active engagement of educators and learners in co-designing a future they desire, to help shape learning and living in an AI world.},

In this research, we aimed to find out whether lecturers are willing to let go of some of the power they currently have in the digital assessment and feedback process and how they see opportunities for agency being developed in the digital assessment and feedback systems. We collected data from 10 sandpits with 58 lecturers in which, using a storytelling technique and one mock-up of a digital assessment and feedback system, we discussed and critiqued an assessment scenario intending to collect perceptions about digital assessment and feedback and the constraints felt by lecturers in their assessment practice. Based on these perceptions, we identify recommendations that may improve digital assessment and feedback systems and practices. We discuss the data and the recommendations based on three clusters of themes: (i) preparation for the assessment, (ii) formative feedback and (iii) feedback post-submission.},

The main goals of this study were: (1) to enhance students' self-regulated learning by shifting the direction of assessment from instructors to the students; and (2) to promote deep active learning in mathematics. Students were required to conduct self-regulated learning on a selected topic. They were encouraged to formulate two multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and pose them after each presentation in an online course. The effectiveness of Student-generated Questions (SGQs) as a learning strategy was measured in terms of: (1) students' engagement; and (2) learning outcomes. While evidence on students' engagement was gathered through an online questionnaire survey, the learning outcomes were measured by analyzing the quality of SGQs. Results indicated that authoring questions, though leading to a higher students' engagement with the materials, could be quite challenging for students and did not lead to higher achievement. The authors provide some suggestions for improving the process through regular uses of digital technologies such as PeerWise.},

This study describes how university students over 18 years of age mobilize cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies through digital games. The research methodology used was ex post facto with a quantitative approach. 941 students from 22 States and from the Federal District, enrolled in higher education courses at Brazilian colleges and universities, participated in this research. Data collection occurred through the application of an online questionnaire that integrates the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (MAI) and the Inventory of Cognitive and Metacognitive Strategies with Digital Games (ICMSDG). The results indicated that university students make regular use of metacognitive knowledge, skills, and strategies. Moreover, cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies seem to be more mobilized by digital game players than by non-players, particularly among those who played over a longer period of time (9 years or more) and with higher intensity (playing every day). With the results found and analyzed, we observe that this study is relevant for both university professors and game designers who aim to promote metacognition skils.},

In the current study, we systematically reviewed 20 papers to better understand the responses of LA tools to the online learning challenges that higher education students, instructors, and institutions faced during the pandemic. In addition, we attempted to provide key cases in which LA has been effectively deployed for various purposes during the pandemic in the higher education context. We found out several prominent challenges for stakeholders. Accordingly, learners needed of timely support and interaction, and experienced difficulty of time management. Instructors lacked pedagogical knowledge for online teaching. In particular, individual and collaborative assessment have been a challenge for them. Institutions have not been ready for a digital transformation and online teaching. In response to these challenges, LA tools have been deployed for the following opportunities: monitoring, planning online learning process, fostering learners' engagement and motivation, facilitating assessment process; increasing interaction, improving retention, being easy to use. Understanding these promises can also give insight into future higher education policies.},

Data regarding individual levels of metacognition were collected through the administration of the "Metacognitive Skills Inventory for Adults" (Schraw \& Dennison, 1994) and translated to Turkish by Ozcan (2007). A separate scale authored by Turan (2009) was administered to the same set of participants to obtain levels of perceived self-regulated learning. Findings indicated that students' self-regulated learning and metacognition total scores correlated with each other but neither scale was predictive of the students' GPAs at a significant level in the hypothesized positive direction. Interestingly, self-regulated learning scores were significantly related to GPA but in a negative direction.},

The context for this paper is a chemical engineering department in a research-intensive university located in central London. Open book exams are used minimally in the degree programmes with retention and knowledge being tested mostly through closed-book exams. The COVID-19 outbreak meant there was now a pressing need to reconsider how students could effectively be assessed under extraordinary circumstances. In the UK [United Kingdom], students were effectively nearing the end of the academic year when ordered into lockdown. Students departed for home, both nationally and overseas and there were only a few options to address assessment. The authors turned to an examination provision that comprised open-book examinations which were taken in fixed, timed sessions. This raised several issues related to: (1) the use of open book exams which many students had not experienced as part of their university assessment; (2) the implication of staggered assessments, accommodating different time zones, given that a large proportion of students are international; (3) using appropriate platforms to deliver and mark exams; and (4) providing pastoral care and support to students during their examination and study periods. This paper outlines the authors' approach to these issues and the impact they have on future assessment provision.},

  abstract = {Not only is research on program evaluation practice and capacity in art museums largely absent, but also the actual dimensions of evaluation capacity as they could be observed in these unique professional settings have heretofore neither been conceptualized or defined based on empirical data. This study sought to (a) develop a framework that conceptualized what evaluation capacity might look like in art museums and (b) examine how such capacity manifested itself across the framework's various dimensions both sector-wide and in those Canadian art museums that were most active in conducting a wide range of research and evaluation studies. A two-phase multiple method qualitative research design was used to address the purposes of this research. Phase One involved conducting an interview study to establish an initial knowledge base on Canadian art museum educators' program evaluation practices and capacities and test the degree to which the initial conceptual framework that was developed to guide this study could be considered an accurate and complete description of evaluation capacity in the Canadian art museum context. Phase Two involved conducting qualitative case studies of two art museums that, based on the interview findings, were identified as operating at the highest level of capacity for evaluation in the country. The study provided the evidence necessary to finalize the initial conceptual framework and concluded that evaluation capacity in Canadian art museums could be described through six central subdivided dimensions. The study results likewise both painted a portrait of moderate capacity for evaluation across the sector (with smaller pockets of high capacity) and shed empirical light on the phenomenon of developed capacity in selected Canadian art museums. In, demarcating the dimensions that comprise evaluation capacity in art museums, this research makes a significant theoretical contribution to the evaluation literature. Several key recommendations that outline what could be done to strengthen the evaluation capacity of art museums in Canada, meanwhile, represent the main practical implication of this study. These recommendations are likely to be useful not only to the growing number of art museums seeking to integrate evaluation into their organizational cultures but also to several other sectors and organizational types.},

  abstract = {Qualitative research suffers from the ``no accepted boilerplate'' problem, which has hampered the progress and broader acceptance of the qualitative research enterprise. This book introduces and demonstrates RQDA, an open-source computer-assisted qualitative data analysis (CAQDAS)-based R extension that increases the transparency and trustworthiness of qualitative research. This book aims to highlight the rise of the Strauss-Corbin-Gioia (SCG) methodology as an important paradigm in qualitative research in the social sciences, and demonstrates how the SCG methodology can be operationalized and enhanced using RQDA. It provides a technical and methodological review of RQDA as a new CAQDAS tool. It uses samples of textual data and demonstrates the development of a data structure and grounded process model using the RQDA-based SCG methodology. Various techniques will be covered, including a general overview of R programming language, the installation of R, RStudio and RQDA; data preparation, data coding techniques, data attributes and memo-ing in RQDA; code abstraction and code plotting in RQDA and grounded theory development as the final output in qualitative research.Unlike other CAQDAS books which merely focuses on the technical aspects of CAQDAS (NVivo by Pat Bazeley; ATLAS.ti by Susanne Friese) or general qualitative research books that do not offer any tools or techniques on how to use the tools to operationalize qualitative research, this book offers a methodological guidance on how to connect CAQDAS tool with accepted paradigms in qualitative research particularly the SCG methodology to produce high quality qualitative research. The book offers a step-by-step instruction on using RQDA under the well-accepted SCR qualitative research paradigm. It provides a complete treatment on the methodological issues in qualitative research such as asking the right question, collecting qualitative data, analyzing and presenting the results in the ways that are appealing to journal editors/reviewers, as well as other stakeholders and publication outlets.This will be the first book that discusses and applies an open source (i.e., free) CAQDAS tool called RQDA for qualitative research in the social sciences; as an alternative to the proprietary tools such as NVivo and ATLAS.ti. This book is timely especially in the era of budget cutting in universities, corporations, and non-profit organizations.This book will help qualitative scholars, quantitative scholars who are familiar with programming languages to ``cross over'' to analyzing qualitative data, as well as PhD/post-doctoral students and coursework students taking qualitative methodology courses in the broader social sciences.},

  abstract = {Universities around the world are encouraging teachers to provide more constructive feedback to support student learning, but do teachers know how to distinguish constructive feedback? What pedagogical practice is considered as feedback and what is not? For example, is a rubric a type of feedback? To date, very limited research has answered these questions from university teachers' perspectives and the current study aims to address this gap. In this study, ten teacher training workshops were conducted in a university in Hong Kong, with an intention to enhance teachers' competence in assessment and feedback. During the workshops, we first adopted Poll Everywhere to survey whether teachers (N = 248) recognise six types of common pedagogical practices as feedback, and subsequently used this as a base to discuss with teachers the reasons behind their responses. Findings reveal teachers' varied perceptions of these practices as feedback, which may be related to their varied understandings of feedback purposes. The paper calls for an explicit acknowledgement of the multiple purposes of feedback, and concludes with implications for teacher feedback literacy in higher education.},

While this pedagogical approach has been adopted online in recent years, incorporating PA into classrooms has proven to be challenging. In this study, mobile-supported PA (M-PA) activities using Instant Response System (IRS) mechanisms to enhance oral proficiency are proposed for English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students. A quasi-experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in the context of an English language course at a university. A total of 60 university students participated, 30 of whom were in the experimental group using the M-PA method and 30 of whom were in the control group using the conventional teacher-only assessment method. The results show that the M-PA method can effectively promote students' oral proficiency, facilitate personal reflection, and foster positive perceptions of learning.},

Focussing on student and faculty experiences of online and distance education, the text provides reflection on novel initiatives, unexpected challenges, and lessons learnt. Responding to the urgent need to better understand online teaching and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, this book investigates how the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) impacted students, faculty, and staff experiences during the COVID-19 lockdown. Chapters initially look at the challenges faced by universities and educators in their attempts to overcome the practical difficulties involved in developing effective online programming and pedagogy. The text then builds on these insights to highlight student experiences and consider issues of social connection and inequality. Finally, the volume looks forward to ask what lessons COVID-19 can offer for the future development of online and distance learning in Higher Education. This engaging volume will benefit researchers, academics, and educators with an interest in online teaching and eLearning, curriculum design, and more specifically those involved with the digitalization of higher education. The text will also support further discussion and reflection around pedagogical transformation, international teaching and learning, and educational policy more broadly. Roy Y.

  abstract = {Project-based learning (PBL) involves a highly complex and learner-centered approach. It relies on formative assessment (FA) with ongoing feedback to help learners move through the PBL process to the eventual co-construction of a shared artefact. Conversation and discussion are central to the process. However, in a face-to-face context of learning, they are difficult to capture for later review or reflection as part of FA. This study investigates the role that technology might play in addressing this limitation using online PBL and FA in a media-creation course in a Thai university. Participants were undergraduate, pre-service teachers preparing to teach English as a foreign language. Objectives included the local design and implementation of online PBL and FA; identification of pre-service teachers' (n = 28) post-implementation perceptions of the convenience, benefits and barriers of this form of learning; perceptions of their PBL skills and; post-implementation measures of PBL knowledge and skills compared with learners participating in a face-to-face section of the course (n = 30). Results revealed that the technology provided a foundational scaffold to support both the learners' and the instructor's activity and interaction. The design of a simple learning management system with communication and file-sharing tools supported not only the learners, but the instructor, not only the assessment, but the learning. Learners' perceptions were positive and post-implementation measures of PBL knowledge and skill were significantly higher for the online section.},

Forty-three empirical studies were selected, and extracted data were synthesised using thematic analysis. The results show that student partnership occurs in four main areas of assessment ? assessment and feedback design, execution and implementation, quality assurance, policy establishment ? and that students adopt the role of co-designers, assessors, consultants and decision-makers in assessment partnerships. The analysis also reveals four types of support university staff can provide to facilitate partnerships: essential knowledge, training and coaching, accuracy and quality check and partnership management. Based on the findings, a framework is proposed to elucidate student partnership in assessment as situated learning in a community of practice. The findings of this review have theoretical and practical implications for policy makers, researchers and practitioners.},

For most students, receiving and outputting electronic text has become the norm, and thus examinations with writing components done by hand may not accurately reflect their abilities. It seems that such traditional handwritten examinations are incongruous when assignments are now expected to be in typed formats, so the question is should it become part of the university assessment policy to make it compulsory for students to type their examinations? To better assist higher education institutions in planning for long-term, future-oriented assessment policies, this study provides a systematic review of the literature focusing on typed and handwritten examinations. A classification scheme of the unambiguous advantages and disadvantages, ambivalent factors, and impacts and perceptions for different stakeholders, is developed based on the findings to provide a thorough and concrete foundation for stakeholders to act upon and navigate the complexities of transitioning to typed examinations.},

Furthermore, with increasingly diverse student cohorts, larger classes and increasing components of teaching delivered online, it is unsurprising that students rate assessment as one of the poorest features of their learning experiences. For these reasons, understanding the specific contexts of assessment is important now more than ever. This paper will present the findings of a case study of a cross-institutional initiative aimed at exploring how to improve digital assessment practice by focusing on context, and encouraging and facilitating collegial collaboration. The aim of the case study was to progress a digital assessment project at an Australian higher education provider. Teams of staff from two higher education providers collaborated to develop and implement eight prototype assessments to reform digital assessment practices. The assessments were selected from online undergraduate academic subjects across a range of disciplines. Findings reveal that both staff and students felt that there were benefits to the cross-institutional collaboration. The resulting assessment was perceived as improving student motivation and engagement and more tailored for the online environment than the existing assessment.},

Our research questions addressed the influence of online design elements on students' perception of learning and learning satisfaction. An online survey was completed by 537 students from 15 online STEM courses in spring 2016. The survey results indicated that student perceptions of learning and satisfaction were correlated with their perceptions of the efficacy of specific design elements, such as integrated active learning activities, interactive engagement strategies, and robust assessment design. In particular, perception of assessment design efficacy was significantly correlated with students' self-perceived learning and learning satisfaction for students of all subpopulations. The findings inform instructors and instructional designers on how to design effective, inclusive, and engaging online STEM courses. Student survey responses were observed to support universal design for learning (UDL) and in light of this, online STEM instructors are also strongly encouraged to utilize UDL principles in course design, which benefit not only students with disabilities but all students.},

It covered 34 countries from 34 full-text English sources in 2018?2022. A total of 12 assumptions were tested, corresponding to six hypotheses about the learning, educating, and management facets associated with the use of technology-based assessments. Our findings revealed mixed evidence about technology-based assessments in reducing cheating, enhancing learning, supporting monitoring, improving instruction, and reducing non-teaching workload. However, strong evidence supported the assumptions that technology-based assessments improve measurement precision, interpretability, engagement, interaction, and teacher-parent communication. Limited but positive evidence supported the assumptions that technology-based assessments may reduce the cost and time of test administration.},

The purpose of this study focused on identifying the common topics between ICT-based assessment and OAoL which is considered as an Open Educational Practice. The review showed that extensive use of the Internet makes it easy to achieve some special features of OAoL as collaboration or sharing, which are considered negative or inconvenient in traditional assessment but at the same time become elements that promote innovation on that topic. It was also found that there is still a great resistance to accept change (as OAoL does) when structural elements of traditional assessment are questioned or challenged.},

  abstract = {E-assessment has been supported in Learning Management Systems for decades. More recently, dedicated e-exam systems have emerged on the market, more specifically supporting the workflow and security needs surrounding high stakes exams. For instance, in Norway, LMS's Canvas and Blackboard are only used for ungraded assessment tasks, while e-exam systems like WISEflow and Inspera Assessment are used for graded ones. Since the systems are mass-market software, vendors must satisfy the needs of several customers, and needs that are specific to only one or a few customers will receive low priority, perhaps forcing teachers to adapt their assessments to what the tool supports, rather than having the tool adapt to the preferred pedagogy. So far, there has been considerable research on views of students and teachers on e-exam systems, much less on the views of vendors and managers. In this paper, we investigate what these stakeholder groups consider to be the key features of e-exam systems, and by what process they are determined. An exploratory case study was conducted, based on interviews with 12 participants belonging to three different groups: vendors, process manager and system managers in Norwegian universities. Our findings indicate much agreement among these groups about key features of e-exam systems, though observing that not all functionality requested by end-users will be prioritized. Also, there was much agreement that a movement towards standardization, open interfaces and digital ecosystems would allow smoother integration with other information systems in the higher education sector, and easier addition of plug-ins for specific functionality -- but that there still is a way to go to reach the ambitions of a flexible ecosystem. Currently, vendors give more priority for adding functional features in e-exam systems rather than better interoperability, and integration with third-party tools remains a challenge. {$\bullet$}Describes the key features of two e-exam solutions that are widely being used in higher education institutions in Norway.{$\bullet$}Describes that the third-party national body procurement of e-exam systems is beneficial for institutions.{$\bullet$}Identifies enablers for vendors, process managers, and universities towards a more open digital ecosystem for e-exams.{$\bullet$}Shows that progress of interoperability between e-exam systems with supporting exam systems is not too impressive.{$\bullet$}Shows that the third-party tools access on BYOD laptops during supervised onsite lockdown e-exams is still in pilot stage.},

The present study aimed to investigate how international students adapt to new academic environments in US universities by exploring the relationships between self-determined motivation, beliefs about classroom assessments, the use of self-regulatory learning strategies, and academic performance based on self-determination theory. To examine international students' learning experiences, 321 international Asian undergraduate students at a large research-intensive midwestern university participated in an online survey. Structural equation modeling was conducted to test the proposed model. The findings demonstrated that self-determined motivation in courses led to adaptive beliefs about classroom assessments, which promoted a variety of self-regulatory learning strategies, including shallow and metacognitive strategies. Metacognitive learning strategies were significantly related to students' academic performance. This study allows us to better understand how Asian international students adapt to US academic environments through their motivation to learn, perspectives about classroom assessments, and learning strategies across different academic disciplines at the university level.},

Several different assessment formats are available for assessing anatomical skills, knowledge and understanding and, as assessment can drive learning, a careful selection of assessments can help to engender the correct deep learning facility required of the safe clinical practitioner. The aim of this review was to survey the published literature to see whether higher education institutions are taking an andragogical approach to assessment. Five databases (EMBASE, ERIC, Medline, PubMed, and Web of Knowledge) were searched using standardized search terms with two limits applied (English language, and 2000 to the present). Among the 2,094 papers found, 32 were deemed suitable for this review. Current literature on assessment can be categorized into the following themes: assessment driven learning, types of assessments, frequency of assessments, and use of images in assessments. The consensus is to use a variety of methods, written and practical, to assess anatomical knowledge and skill in different domains. Institutions aim for different levels of Bloom's taxonomy for students at similar stages of their medical degree. Formative assessments are used widely, in differing formats, with mostly good effects on the final examination grade. In conclusion, a wide variety of assessments, each aimed at a different level of Bloom's taxonomy, are used by different institutions. Clin.

To achieve this aim, a multi-treatment group randomisation study was conducted to compare the impact of the DA with the impact of the Competency-Based Approach (CBA) on developing assessment skills and promoting student learning outcomes. Assessment skills of 178 teachers and achievement of their students (n = 2358) were measured before and after the intervention. The DA had greater impact on teacher assessment skills and student learning outcomes than the CBA. Differential effects were also identified since differences in the impact of each approach were only identified for teachers who were situated at higher stages of assessment skills. Implications of findings for research, policy and practice are drawn.}

  abstract = {In a world driven by constant change and innovation, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are undergoing a rapid transformation, often driven by external factors such as emerging technologies. One of the key drivers affecting the design and development of educational delivery mechanisms in HEIs is the fast pace of educational technology development which not only impacts an institution's technical capacity to infuse hardware and software solutions into existing learning infrastructure but also has implications for pedagogical practice, stakeholder acceptance of new technology, and HEI administrative structures. However, little is known about the implementation of contemporary educational technology in HEI environments, particularly as they relate to competing stakeholder perceptions of technology effectiveness in course delivery and knowledge acquisition. This review fills that gap by exploring the evidence and analyses of 46 empirical research studies focussing on technology implementation issues in a diverse range of institutional contexts, subject areas, technologies, and stakeholder profiles. This study found that the dynamic interplay of educational technology characteristics, stakeholder perceptions on the effectiveness of technology integration decisions, theoretical frameworks and models relevant to technology integration in pedagogical practices, and metrics to gauge post-implementation success are critical dimensions to creating viable pathways to effective educational technology~implementation. To that end, this study proposes a framework to guide the development of sound implementation strategies that incorporates five dimensions: technology, stakeholder perceptions, academic discipline, success metrics, and theoretical frameworks. This study will benefit HEI decision-makers responsible for re-engineering complex course delivery systems to accommodate the infusion of new technologies and pedagogies in ways that will maximise their utility to students and faculty.},

This paper discusses a method and necessary strategies to confront this challenge. Design/methodology/approach In this study, a language model was defined to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing ChatGPT-generated essays from human written essays with a particular focus on ``not falsely'' classifying genuinely human-written essays as AI-generated (Negative). Findings Via support vector machine (SVM) algorithm 100\% accuracy was recorded for identifying human generated essays. The author discussed the key use of Recall and F2 score for measuring classification performance and the importance of eliminating False Negatives and making sure that no actual human generated essays are incorrectly classified as AI generated. The results of the proposed model's classification algorithms were compared to those of AI-generated text detection software developed by OpenAI, GPTZero and Copyleaks. Practical implications AI-generated essays submitted by students can be detected by teachers and educational designers using the proposed language model and machine learning (ML) classifier at a high accuracy. Human (student)-generated essays can and must be correctly identified with 100\% accuracy even if the overall classification accuracy performance is slightly reduced. Originality/value This is the first and only study that used an n-gram bag-of-words (BOWs) discrepancy language model as input for a classifier to make such prediction and compared the classification results of other AI-generated text detection software in an empirical way.}

In Teaching Online, Claire Howell Major describes for college faculty the changes that accompany use of such technologies and offers real-world strategies for surmounting digital teaching challenges.Teaching with these evolving media requires instructors to alter the ways in which they conceive of and do their work, according to Major. They must frequently update their knowledge of learning, teaching, and media, and they need to develop new forms of instruction, revise and reconceptualize classroom materials, and refresh their communication patterns. Faculty teaching online must also reconsider the student experience and determine what changes for students ultimately mean for their own work and for their institutions. Teaching Online presents instructors with a thoughtful synthesis of educational theory, research, and practice as well as a review of strategies for managing the instructional changes involved in teaching online. In addition, this book presents examples of best practices from successful online instructors as well as cutting-edge ideas from leading scholars and educational technologists.

This manuscript highlights how one counselor education program implemented digital portfolios as a means for fostering student reflection, and subsequently evolved the portfolios towards satisfying both comprehensive exam and student employment goals. The author introduced a digital portfolio component to a core curriculum course in hopes of fostering students' reflection. Simultaneously, counselor education program faculty were addressing inadequacies of norm-referenced testing employed for students' comprehensive exam. Together faculty pursued building assessment components within the reflection blogs, utilizing the platform as digital portfolios. This effort was aimed at meeting three goals: (1) fostering student reflection; (2) satisfying program comprehensive exam/assessment requirements; and (3) serving as a professional website for students' post-program employment searches/interviews. Students receiving formative feedback on their digital reflections demonstrated significantly higher mean reflection scores than students only utilizing portfolios as a "digital journal". This manuscript presents an overview of the initiative in its first year of implementation, resources and obstacles experienced, and preliminary findings from data collected. Technology platform information and student work samples are highlighted.},

The current study reviews the development of online teaching in Israel's higher education and examines whether this development derives from an organized and well-formulated public policy with a view to the future or is the result of the constraints and various actors within the free market. In addition, the study presents a case study of an academic institution, examining the opinions of students with regard to the benefits and shortcomings of online teaching. The research findings indicate that the development of online teaching in Israel is the result of needs, constraints, and opportunities that emerged in the free market rather than a result of organized public policy by the Ministry of Education and the Council for Higher Education. Consequently, the study presents the various implications of these unregulated developments for the quality of teaching and for student satisfaction. The study illuminates a thorough discussion that should be conducted by movers of higher education and academic institutions concerning a new effective designation of the campuses following the COVID-19 crisis as well as the distinction between virtual and real-life dimensions of academic teaching.},

The aim of this study was to investigate learning outcomes and the students' attitudes to online Moodle quizzes in order to improve instructional design. The research population included 204 college students enrolled in life sciences who were participating in an introductory physics course. A blended learning model was used, based on large, traditional face-to-face lectures, practice sessions held with smaller groups of about 25 students and a rich Moodle learning environment. The students' knowledge and understanding were assessed weekly throughout the semester, using two different methods: three ordinary short written tests and online quizzes in the Moodle environment. The students' attitudes towards the online quizzes as compared to the written tests were investigated by questionnaire. Results indicate that both the average grade on written tests and the average grade on online quizzes were found to be significant predictors of the grade on the final exam. Students significantly improved their scores and greatly shortened their performance time on the last attempts of the online quiz, as compared to their first attempts. The investigation into the students' attitudes towards online quizzes reveals a generally positive attitude. Learning outcomes and the students' attitudes to online Moodle quizzes were considered to improve instructional design, which demonstrates formative assessment in higher education.},

Researchers compared the factors associated with faculty members assigning students to work in groups to solve ill-defined design problems with their use of traditional lecture and textbook problem set assignments. The study hypothesized that faculty members use of teaching practices is a function of their backgrounds, training, experiences, teaching goals, beliefs in their own skills, and their perceptions of the extent to which their organizations provide adequate rewards and resources for teaching. The total sample for the analysis, 426, represented 61\% of the population of tenured and tenure-track engineering faculty at 3 universities. Participants completed a seven-section instrument that gathered information about teaching practices and beliefs. Findings indicate that faculty members own goals for teaching and beliefs about their own professional skills are strongly associated with the extent to which they use traditional teaching practices or group design projects.

The framework draws from the existing literature and includes both theoretical and empirical considerations. Two important examples, one from international business and one from marketing, illustrate the use of the framework. Both examples concern constructs that are fundamental to theory-building in these disciplines, and constructs that most scholars measure reflectively. In contrast, applying the framework suggests that a formative measurement model may be more appropriate. These results reinforce the need for all researchers to justify, both theoretically and empirically, their choice of measurement model. Use of an incorrect measurement model undermines the content validity of constructs, misrepresents the structural relationships between them, and ultimately lowers the usefulness of management theories for business researchers and practitioners. The main contribution of this paper is to question the unthinking assumption of reflective measurement seen in much of the business literature.},

The Technology Acceptance Model and ADKAR model were used as conceptual frameworks. This study adopted a qualitative approach: interviews were conducted with 26 lecturers during 2015 and 2016. The data showed that computer-assisted assessment (multiple-choice questions) have certain challenges, but can also contribute to a more effective open distance learning assessment strategy. Recommendations were formulated according to findings. The article concludes that computer-assisted assessment has a place in an open distance learning context.},

I use the term Indigenous to refer to First Peoples' and their wisdom traditions from places around the world and the term Aboriginal to refer to the diverse First Nations, M{\'e}tis, and Inuit peoples of Canada. The article looks at the ethical imperative for doing socially innovative work, and examines practices with potential for embedding social innovation in educational scholarship, including experiential and relational educational approaches, such as community-service learning and restorative justice; participatory action research as an allied research approach; and community arts framed as cultural democracy. It describes a research project with street-involved youth as a case study for research that moves toward social innovation through the Government of Canada Policy Research Initiative's five steps involved in a co-creative social innovation project.]}

The data gathering method was a questionnaire administered to 247 students on the Education Degree at the University of Barcelona. Regarding our first aim, it was confirmed that although the portfolio and rubrics were used in combination, students viewed each of them independently. Regarding the second aim, we identified four groups and a range of factors that may explain the varying perceptions of the portfolios and rubrics. Favorable factors were, in first place, greater teacher experience in using the digital portfolios; second, continuous technical support for their use; third, their having greater weight in assessment; and fourth, smaller class sizes.},

The reviews could be accessed in test format, in which students were given multiple-choice questions and provided correct answer feedback, or in read format in which students were given the same questions and were shown the correct answers. Students who used the test format performed better on exams than students who used the read format or did not use the reviews. Nevertheless, the massive majority of the online reviews (approximately 88\%) were not completed, highlighting the tendency for students to underutilize optional online reviews.

This research focuses on how formative assessment can be used to improve the teaching-learning process and provide students with feedback about their progress rather than just grades. The main aim is to analyze how individual formative self-assessment processes - via the Socrative application (SA) and Moodle questionnaires (MQ) - affect the teaching-learning process and whether they improve student performance and satisfaction. A quantitative methodology (a case study) was used. The sample studied consisted of 374 students (315 women and 59 men) from the second year of the Teaching degree. Of these, 245 were part of a control group who did not participate in any self-assessment, and 129 were part of the experimental group (SA: 77 students and MQ: 52 students). Results show that the use of self-assessment tools during the teaching process improved the academic performance by around one point out of ten and generated a good level of satisfaction among students and teachers. Overall, no significant differences were found between MQ and SA in relation to satisfaction and performance. The results also indicate that the use of a self-assessment tool by itself is not enough to bring about a change in the way students learn. Thus, other factors should be investigated for greater insight into the variables involved in the student learning process.},

Accordingly, this paper addresses a number of gaps in the scholarly interface between Twitter and MOOCs by undertaking a comprehensive mapping of the current literature. In so doing the paper examines research design through: data collection and analysis techniques; scope and scale of existing studies; and theoretical approaches and underpinnings in the empirical research published between 2011 and 2017. Findings serve to demonstrate the diversity of this line of research, particularly in scale and scope of studies and in the approaches taken. By mapping the research using a systematic review methodology it is shown that there is a lack of qualitative data on how Twitter is used by learners and teachers in MOOCs. Moreover, a number of methodological gaps exist in published quantitative survey research at the interface between Twitter and MOOCs, including issues in the trustworthy reporting of results and full consideration of tweet and tweet meta-data collection. At the same time the paper highlights areas of methodological ``best practice'' in the research around these issues and in other important areas such as large-scale hashtag analyses of the use of Twitter in MOOCs. In reviewing the literature the findings aim to strengthen the methodological foundation of future work and help shape a stronger research agenda in this emerging area.},

However, there are concerns that these instead proliferate forms of exclusion and do not address known difficulties for widening participation. We explore how organisations that represent the perspectives of particular underserved audiences for HE can act as 'Learner Representative Partners' to support the creation of appropriate courses and to highlight practices that exclude. Six course development processes where a university worked with different partners are analysed using interviews, documentation of resource use, and data on learner behaviour. The analysis utilises previously identified challenges to widening participation and collaborative course creation. Getting partners to directly engage in authoring the course was particularly beneficial but all partners prompted critical thought and greater understanding of the intended audiences. We suggest principles to support such partnerships effectively. These include adapting to a variable capacity of partners to contribute, to encourage reuse or creation of resources by partners, and to facilitate partners to feel confident in expressing their views.},

The scope of this impact is hard to grasp partly because the literature is siloed, as well as the changing meaning of the concepts themselves. But developments are surrounded by controversies in terms of what is technically possible, what is practical to implement and what is desirable, pedagogically or for the good of society. Design fictions that vividly imagine future scenarios of AI or robotics in use offer a means both to explain and query the technological possibilities. The paper describes the use of a wide-ranging narrative literature review to develop eight such design fictions that capture the range of potential use of AI and robots in learning, administration and research. They prompt wider discussion by instantiating such issues as how they might enable teaching of high order skills or change staff roles, as well as exploring the impact on human agency and the nature of datafication.},

  abstract = {Open educational practices (OEP) is a broad descriptor of practices that include the creation, use, and reuse of open educational resources (OER) as well as open pedagogies and open sharing of teaching practices. As compared with OER, there has been little empirical research on individual educators' use of OEP for teaching in higher education. This research study addresses that gap, exploring the digital and pedagogical strategies of a diverse group of university educators, focusing on whether, why, and how they use OEP for teaching. The study was conducted at one Irish university; semi-structured interviews were carried out with educators across multiple disciplines. Only a minority of educators used OEP. Using constructivist grounded theory, a model of the concept ``Using OEP for teaching'' was constructed showing four dimensions shared by open educators: balancing privacy and openness, developing digital literacies, valuing social learning, and challenging traditional teaching role expectations. The use of OEP by educators is complex, personal, and contextual; it is also continually negotiated. These findings suggest that research-informed policies and collaborative and critical approaches to openness are required to support staff, students, and learning in an increasingly complex higher education environment.},

Particular attention is given to outcomes involving learning strategies, motivation, and achievement. Where possible, mechanisms are suggested that could account for the reported effects. The conclusions derived from the individual fields are then merged to produce an integrated summary with clear implications for effective educational practice. The primary conclusion is that classroom evaluation has powerful direct and indirect impacts, which may be positive or negative, and thus deserves very thoughtful planning and implementation.},

  abstract = {There is a growing demand for assessment instruments which can be used in higher education, which cover a broader area of competencies than the traditional tests for disciplinary knowledge and domain-specific skills, and which measure students' most important general cognitive capabilities. Around the age of the transition from secondary to tertiary education, such assessments may serve several functions, including selecting the best-prepared candidates for certain fields of study. Dynamic problem-solving (DPS) is a good candidate for such a role, as tasks that assess it involve knowledge acquisition and knowledge utilization as well. The purpose of this study is to validate an online DPS test and to explore its potential for assessing students' DPS skills at the beginning of their higher education studies. Participants in the study were first-year students at a major Hungarian university (n = 1468). They took five tests that measured knowledge from their previous studies: Hungarian language and literature, mathematics, history, science and English as a Foreign Language (EFL). A further, sixth test based on the MicroDYN approach, assessed students' DPS skills. A brief questionnaire explored learning strategies and collected data on students' background. The testing took place at the beginning of the first semester in three 2-h sessions. Problem-solving showed relatively strong correlations with mathematics (r = 0.492) and science (r = 0.401), and moderate correlations with EFL (r = 0.227), history (r = 0.192), and Hungarian (r = 0.125). Weak but still significant correlations were found with certain learning strategies, positive correlations with elaboration strategies, and a negative correlation with memorization strategies. Significant differences were observed between male and female students; men performed significantly better in DPS than women. Results indicated the dominant role of the first phase of solving dynamic problems, as knowledge acquisition correlated more strongly with any other variable than knowledge utilization.},

Before this study, postgraduate students studying online in a course intended primarily as professional development for language educators were taking the course through reading the course literature including assigned articles, writing reflective texts in the asynchronous forum and doing the course assignments. They had a very different experience than the campus students who met weekly for discussion of the reading. Some online students were not active enough in the course, and showed low levels of engagement. The online students were invited to participate in scheduled campus classes via Skype on iPads. After some hesitation, four of the six online students took up this real-time participation option. Initial difficulties with the technology were addressed after seeking input from campus and online students. A series of adjustments were made and evaluated, including a move to a model in which three online students in different locations participated in a single Skype group video call on a laptop in the campus classroom rather than on multiple individual Skype calls on iPads. After the course, the online and campus students were asked to evaluate the experience of having physical and virtual participants sharing a physical space and to relate this experience to the asynchronous channels previously available to the participants. The comments of both groups of participants were interpreted in the light of previous work on social presence and of activity theory. It appears that student beliefs and student expectations lead to hidden challenges associated with mixing these groups of students, and the study concludes that unless teaching assistance is available, it is not easy to afford online students the same right to speak as campus students.},

Desiring to find a method that was locally appropriate and resonant with the narrative wisdom of the community, yet cognizant of the limitations of interview-based narrative research, our team sought to discover an indigenous method that united the digital media with storytelling. Using a case study that illustrates the usage of digital storytelling within an indigenous community, this article will share how digital storytelling can stand as a community-driven methodological strategy that addresses, and moves beyond, the limitations of narrative research and the issues of colonization of research and the Western analytic project. In so doing, this emerging method can preserve and promote indigenous oral wisdom, while engaging community members, developing capacities, and celebrating myriad stories, lived experiences, and lifeworlds.}

The coronavirus pandemic, however, pushed project-oriented game programs all over the world towards an implementation of ad hoc approaches to remote development in their project-based courses. The present article demonstrates practice-based research examining such a course and its 30 third-year undergraduate students of game arts, game design, and game programming, who remotely collaborated in interdisciplinary groups of two to five persons over the course of half a semester during Germany's logdown in spring 2020. Applying a mixed-method approach including quantitative and qualitative analyses of survey data (n=22) and qualitative content analyses of students' postmortem documentations (n=30), this exploratory study reconstructed the online practices, experiences, and learning processes of these students between their professional routines and psychosocial challenges. The results of this study can be used in curriculum development to inform the advancement of courses focused on the development of prototypes over physical distance, which may not only be relevant for the field of games education, but also for related creative and project-oriented fields of higher education, such as design, digital media, and software engineering.},

Specifically, we explored the participants' training, experience, and perceived skills in testing and assessment; their perceptions about EAP testing and assessment; their approaches to and practices of EAP testing and assessment; and their testing- and assessment-related professional development needs. In addition to revealing the participating EAP instructors' assessment approaches and practices in the Canadian context, the results highlighted a reported paucity of training in EAP testing and assessment both within and outside of teacher-education programs. They also revealed self-perceived gaps of EAP instructors regarding their lack of assessment knowledge, skills in developing tests, skills in aligning needs with tests and assessments, and self-confidence in designing, modifying, and implementing tests. The sharing of these results is intended to raise awareness of the current testing and assessment practices of EAP instructors in the Canadian context, with the hope of opening a dialogue about them as well as reflecting on ways to encourage the sharing of knowledge, skills, and understanding about these practices within the professional community.}

Videos are routinely used by educators in higher education settings throughout the United States. It is unknown, however, if closed captions are educationally beneficial for all students. The purpose of this study was to examine the educational benefits of closed captioning among college students without disabilities and their associated attitudes toward the technology. The use of closed captions adheres to the principles of Universal Design that encourage stakeholders to build environments and products that are accessible to all individuals. However, more evidence-based research is needed on the utility of this technology in college classrooms. Two separate video-based studies were conducted at one university, and groups were randomly assigned to "caption" or "no-caption" conditions. It was hypothesized that exposure to closed captions would increase students' recall and understanding of video-based information and improve attitudes toward the technology. Results suggested that participants who were exposed to closed captions scored significantly higher on the subsequent assessment. Participants who already used closed captions in their daily lives had significantly more positive attitudes toward the technology. Recommendations for college-level educators and further study are provided.},

We operationalised approaches to instruction and assessment according to Achievement Goal Theory, postulating that pre-service teachers approach instruction and assessment from either a mastery or performance perspective. The results from a correlational study of 344 Canadian pre-service teachers showed that intended instruction and assessment practices were separated according to mastery and performance approaches. However, there was also alignment between the concepts such that pre-service teachers who had a mastery approach to instruction were more inclined towards a mastery approach to assessment. Approaches to assessment were also related to pre-service teachers' conceptions: beliefs that assessment holds students and schools accountable were positively related to a performance approach to assessment. In contrast, a belief that assessment improves teaching was positively related to a mastery approach to assessment and negatively to a performance approach. We discuss relationships between conceptions of assessment, approaches to classroom instruction and assessment as conceptualised from an Achievement Goal Theory perspective.},

However, teaching students concepts of rigour and how to apply them to their research is challenging. This article presents a generic framework of rigour with four critical dimensions---Trustworthiness, Auditability, Credibility and Transferability (TACT) intended to teach issues of rigour to postgraduate students and those new to qualitative research methodology. The framework enables them to explore the key dimensions necessary for assessing the rigour of qualitative research studies and checklist questions against each of the dimensions. TACT was offered through 10 workshops, attended by 64 participants. Participants positively evaluated the workshops and reported that the workshops enable them to learn the principles of qualitative research and better understanding issues of rigour.

  abstract = {Background: Within a socio-constructivist perspective, this study is situated at the crossroads of three theoretical approaches. First, it is based upon team sport and the tactical act model in games teaching. Second, it took place in dyadic or small group learning conditions with verbal interaction. Furthermore, these interventions were based on cooperative learning (CL) models. The cultural context is the French school curriculum, so it emphasizes the role of sports as social practice and uses the applied concept of French didactic transposition. It took place in a socio-constructivist perspective of the teaching-learning process and extends the notion of debate-of-idea. Purpose: This article explores the role of CL in a Physical Education (PE) classroom setting and particularly the role of verbal exchanges among peers in team-sport teaching. Research design: This article reports two interventions. The first study showed the positive effects of discussions within a team in an adapted basketball game. Seventeen boys and 13 girls from a French school (third and fourth grades), all novices in basketball, were assigned to two independent groups of a two (Learning condition) design. Dependent measures included collective game efficacy and individual skill levels. A second study concerned an instructional setting of a handball team game (two attackers against a defender in each half of the ground) with 11?12-year-old girls. Two groups were constituted by learning condition: symmetrical versus dissymmetrical dyads. Data collection and analysis: During PE lessons, verbal interactions were filmed and recorded for the two studies. Matches were filmed in study 1, while data in study 2 were collected by an expert on an observation worksheet. ANOVA were conducted in both studies. Results: The two studies showed that oral discussions between peers about the goal and the strategies of the game facilitated the development of motor and tactical skills. The second study showed the superiority of a slightly dissymmetric dyadic condition. The low-skilled pupils in dissymmetrical dyads obtained more benefit from the verbal interactions than those in a symmetrical setting. In the dissymmetrical condition, while the initially low-skilled participants had the highest rate of progression, the initially high-skilled players had to explain their solution and could also benefit from the dyadic interaction. Conclusion: In both studies, action rules were constructed by peers' verbal exchanges in a reflective way. In a PE socio-constructivist setting, the teaching of games facilitates mutual aid, social relationships, and participation in community activities.}

Three cohorts of participants were included in the study: preservice teachers of TEFL (n = 104), TEFL university instructors (n = 23), and heads of TEFL departments (n = 10). Data was collected using a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The Kruskal Wallis test was used to detect differences among participants' perspectives. Preservice teachers' mid-term and final scores in the online courses were also compared. Results show significant differences among the perspectives of the three participant groups regarding online courses. The preservice teachers appeared to have relatively positive attitudes about online learning, while the university instructors and department heads showed lower levels of satisfaction with this medium. Participants identified several challenges in online learning, including lack of rigor in online courses, lack of credibility of course certificates, lack of technological infrastructures, technical problems, lack of practical content in the lessons, lack of human interaction, students' low knowledge of the content, and employers' lack of interest in employing graduates of online courses. Participants also noted the need for pedagogical and technological training for both university instructors and preservice teachers of TEFL. The comparison of preservice teachers' mid-term and final scores in the online courses showed a significant difference and improvement in students' learning achievements with medium to large effect sizes. In the interviews, participants confirmed that online courses could improve student learning.},

On the contrary, using traditional storytelling as a research method links Indigenous worldviews, shaping the approach of the research; the theoretical and conceptual frameworks; and the epistemology, methodology, and ethics. The aims of this article are to (a) explore the essential elements and the value of traditional storytelling for culturally appropriate Indigenous research; (b) develop a model of a collaborative community and university research alliance, looking at how to address community concerns and gather data that will inform decision-making and help the community prepare for the future; (c) build up and strengthen research capacity among Indigenous communities in collaboration with Indigenous Elders and Knowledge-holders; and (d) discuss how to more fully engage Indigenous people in the research process. In two case studies with Indigenous and immigrant communities in Canada and Bangladesh that are grounded in the relational ways of participatory action research, the author found that traditional storytelling as a research method could lead to culturally appropriate research, build trust between participants and researcher, build a bridge between Western and Indigenous research, and deconstruct meanings of research. The article ends with a discussion of the implications of using traditional storytelling in empowering both research participants and researcher.}

If distance education is an option for expanding educational opportunities, online learning environments should be scrutinized to ensure learner engagement and meaningful support for Indigenous students. This thesis uses a Community of Inquiry (CoI) (Garrison, Anderson \& Archer, 2000) framework to examine existing literature and to frame the voices of 21 Indigenous participants about their experiences of supports, preferences, and online best practices. By exploring, understanding and incorporating what may be unique preferences, cultures, languages, worldviews, and ways of knowing, mechanisms to transform distance learning environments to improve engagement for Indigenous students can be identified. With the aim of synthesizing potential findings with online best practices, it may be possible to transform online delivery and development to provide a rich educational experience for students.},

This article builds on and consolidates research that has taken place over ten years that evaluates assessment literacies among HE lecturers in education and science, and in staff developers, by presenting a comparative view of the data. The results indicate that there was generally a good understanding of theoretical and practical aspects of summative assessment across all groups. However, understandings of formative assessment showed little concordance between and within the groups, particularly among staff developers, but this group was better at clarifying the necessary link between formative assessment and feedback. Although education lecturers had a firmer grasp of central terminologies, in general there are still deficits in understanding about how these terms interrelate. Staff developers' relative weakness of understanding in some areas is of concern since this group shapes those who teach. These issues are exacerbated by a lack of acknowledgement that they exist, which may seriously hamper the development of both staff and students in clarifying processes they encounter daily. Basic shared understandings are required that can translate into personal, coherent assessment literacies. As a community we need to take on this task, because if we do not, as individuals, or individual groups, we will continue to have fragmented assessment literacies.},

  abstract = {How can learners be supported to engage productively in the kinds of feedback practices they may encounter after they graduate? This article introduces a novel concept of authentic feedback to denote processes which resemble the feedback practices of the discipline, profession or workplace. Drawing on the notion of authentic assessment, a framework for authentic feedback is proposed with five dimensions: realism, cognitive challenge, affective challenge, evaluative judgement and enactment of feedback. This framework is exemplified and interrogated through two cases of authentic feedback practice, one in the subject of digital media in an Australian university, the other focussed on bedside rounds in medicine at a university in Hong Kong. The framework enables the identification of both highly authentic aspects of feedback, and aspects that could be made more authentic. The framework informs the design of feedback practices that carry the potential to bridge university and workplace environments.},

  abstract = {AbstractThe ability of students to plagiarise coursework assessments has been a topic of much debate in recent years. The consequences of plagiarism for students may be devastating, since their failure to learn and use appropriate study skills will affect both their university experience and their subsequent career. This project set out to investigate students? perceptions of what constitutes plagiarism. A scenario-based questionnaire was given to undergraduate bioscience students from Level 0, that is, Foundation level, to Level 3. Analysis of the completed questionnaires showed student uncertainty about several aspects of plagiarism, including downloading of material from the Internet. Students were unclear about the distinctions between collusion, plagiarism and permissible group work. Thus, despite the media attention given to plagiarism, students are not always aware of the boundaries between plagiarism and acceptable practice. Since the penalties for plagiarising may be severe, it is essential that guidelines are provided early in the programme. A case-study approach is more likely to engage the students than issuing them with a set of penalties should they be caught.As a result of these findings guidelines have been produced, aimed at addressing misconceptions. Future work is planned to adapt the exercise to an interactive format within a managed learning environment.}

Since university teachers usually design their own assessments, it is important to investigate their conceptions of assessment. The current study focuses on teachers' conceptions of their current and ideal assessment with a focus on intermediate assessment. Thirteen teachers teaching law, psychology and criminology, reflected on their current and ideal assessment in an attempt to eliminate the influence of practical constraints on assessment practice. Results indicate that the majority of teachers have transformational conceptions of their intermediate assessment practice, and in general, their conceptions of the ideal assessment are even more transformational. This suggests that teachers' main focus for assessment is on student learning and that a lack of transformational assessments in practice may be mainly caused by external constraints.},

The basic notions of explanatory item response models (EIRM) are explained in this chapter and three kinds of application are presented. All three applications are based on data from a spelling test and the lme4 code for model estimation is included for all three. The first application illustrates how EIRM can be used as a technology for test construction and item generation, starting from the explanation of item difficulties even when that explanation is far from perfect. The second application demonstrates how EIRM can be a basis for diagnostic assessment through the explanation of test performance based on item attributes linked with cognitive processes. The third application shows how EIRM provides us with a tool to correct ability estimates that are affected by confounding using a new dimensionality method that allows the source of confounding to vary depending on the person.},

Peer assessment has been advocated as a means of formative assessment to enhance student engagement, empowering students to take responsibility for their own learning. While there is accumulating evidence for the value of peer assessment in higher education, one cannot assume peer feedback will translate appropriately to all settings and educational contexts. This study evaluated the implementation of formative online peer assessment in a nursing and midwifery research methods module. We explored students' expectations, experiences, and ultimately the acceptability of this approach. A quantitative descriptive study. Ireland. An online survey to collate expectations and experiences of engagement in peer assessment. Scales were drawn from previous research and non-parametric tests explored changes in perceptions over time. Qualitative content analysis explored patterns evident in open-text responses. The response rate was 28\% (n~=~74) at baseline and 31\% at follow-up (n~=~81). Peer assessment was a new experience for 95\% of respondents. Students initially expressed apprehension, perceiving the task as daunting, and doubting their ability to provide feedback to peers. However, through providing instruction and tools to support students in the activity, high levels of satisfaction with the process and the experience were reported. Significant differences in perceptions of peer assessment were evident over time, including an enhanced belief that respondents had the requisite skills to appraise the work of their peers. In sum, nursing and midwifery students agreed that peer assessment was a valuable learning experience as part of research methods training and critical skills development.},

In a second part, contemporary MOOC platforms that have concretized out of this milieu are analyzed. Different types of operations that enact a very specific figure of the open learner (and types of open learning) are advanced: The open learner is increasingly being lured and made flexible, controlled and molded, communalized and responsibilized, and finally trained and empowered.

To determine the effectiveness and efficiency of the model we explored the online discussions in two case studies. We evaluated the quantity of the interactions by looking at quantitative data of the discussion `threads' and we evaluated the quality of the discussion by content analysis of the individual messages. Both the procedural facilitation of the discussion and the instrument for content analysis were based on Garrison's `Practical Inquiry model of Cognitive Presence'. Furthermore, we explored the experiences of the students and moderators by interviewing them and we organised their perceptions using the framework of an activity system. On the basis of the quantitative and qualitative data we conclude that the e-learning model was successful in establishing a dialogue among a group of students and an expert during work placements at different locations. The `Practical Inquiry model' was useful in facilitating a sustained on-topic discourse involving critical thinking. Although the amount of critical thinking was moderate, the results suggest ways to increase integration and resolution activities in the online discussions.},

Open-ended tasks allow a more in-depth assessment of students' learning levels, but their evaluation and grading are time-consuming and prone to subjective bias. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, most traditional Higher Education courses converted to online courses; automatic grading and feedback tools and methods (AGFTM) have become critical components of online learning systems, especially with regards to short answers and essays assessment. This work frames the recent advancement in AGFTM through a systematic mapping of the research field and a literature review. This analysis gives an overview of the trends, specific goals, methods, quality of proposals, challenges and limitations in this research area.

The integration of competence-based learning as an educational benchmark has also led to a perspective more focused on student and with complex learning situations closer to reality. However, its assessment entails an increase in lecturers' workload and a continuous demand for students due to the diversity of assessment tests required to assess each aspect of competences. After a period in which those changes have been introduced, the Technical University of Madrid (UPM) considered to analyse the assessment systems and the ways to improve them, at both bachelor's and master's degree programmes. The methodology used is based on the model "Working with People", which for the first time at the UPM, creates a participatory process with students and lecturers aimed at knowing their opinion and their feelings about the assessment process and the potential for improvement. Eight WWW-workshops were developed, with 32 students and 39 university teachers in total. The results indicate that the perception of students and lecturers regarding the assessment systems have many common points, as well as the need to undertake an improvement strategy for integrating actions from all three model dimensions, seeking a balance in joint work among lecturers, university administrators and students. This work has been performed within the framework of educational innovations cross-cutting project named "Analysis of the UPM Degree Programmes Evaluation Procedures and Proposal for Improvements" (EVAL{\'U}A), supported by the Educational Innovation Department.},

Limited assessment education that is potentially misaligned to assessment standards and classroom practices has been identified as one factor contributing to a lack of assessment competency. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to analyze the alignment between teacher education accreditation policies, professional standards for teacher assessment practice, and preservice assessment course curriculum. Through a curriculum alignment methodology involving two policy documents, two professional standards documents, and syllabi from 10 Florida-based, Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education--certified teacher education programs, the results of this study serve to identify points of alignment and misalignment across policies, standards, and curricula.

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, a global movement towards accountability in education has emerged. This movement is marked by government demands for ever higher academic standards and commensurate student achievement throughout education systems, and the proliferation of student assessments at all levels -- classroom, district, state, national and international (Nichols \& Harris, 2016; Stobart, 2008). Accountability has become the prevailing watchword, with teacher assessment capability (and assessment literacy) now considered a fundamental competency for all educators (Popham, 2009; Xu \& Brown, 2016). Educational policies and professional standards throughout the world call for educators to integrate assessments throughout instruction to support, monitor and report on student learning, and to use summative forms of assessment to document and demonstrate achievement of educational standards (DeLuca, LaPointe-McEwan, \& Luhanga, 2016; Gotch \& French, 2014). The accountability movement is supported by educational research that confirms assessment-based teaching as a potentially effective educational strategy to improve student achievement (e.g. Black \& Wiliam, 1998; Hattie, 2009). Stressing the importance of assessment literacy, James Popham (2009, p. 4) notes `educators' inadequate knowledge in assessment can cripple the quality of education. Assessment literacy is seen as a sine qua non for today's competent educator'. Likewise, Johnson (2011, p. 121), in the context of summative assessment for system monitoring, observes that `the increasing politicisation of assessment over recent decades has strengthened [the] need for a high degree of assessment literacy among practitioners and others involved in the business of education'. DeLuca and Bellara (2013) further comment that as the landscape of educational assessment changes to include accountability mandates and standards-based teaching but also studentcentred pedagogies and student-directed assessments, `there is a continued need to shift preservice assessment education experiences that prepare teachers to embrace multiple purposes and practices of assessment in schools' (p. 367). Despite these widespread calls for assessment capable teachers, research indicates that teachers generally maintain low levels of assessment knowledge and skills, with beginning teachers particularly unprepared for assessment in schools (DeLuca \& Klinger, 2010; MacLellan, 2004). This persistent finding is unsurprising as assessment has historically been a neglected area of study in teacher education programmes, at least in Anglophone countries (La Marca, 2006; Shepard, Hammerness, Darling-Hammond, \& Rust, 2005; Stiggins, 1999; Taras, 2007). Moreover, current teacher education models maintain several challenges for supporting teacher candidates' and initial teachers' developing conceptions and practices of assessment. The often short and fragmented (i.e. on-campus versus practicum) structure of teacher education programmes, diversity of instructors and variability in their approaches to assessment, and competing learning priorities limit the consistency and prominence of effective assessment education within initial preparatory programmes (DeLuca \& Volante, 2016; Taras, 2007). Instructors' own levels of assessment capability might also, in some cases, be lacking. Once in field, and especially within their first five years, beginning teachers work to establish confidence across their practice with explicit professional learning in assessment not always accessible or available. Instead, practising teachers tend to learn about assessment through},

  abstract = {Research has consistently demonstrated that teachers' assessment actions have a significant influence on students' learning experience and achievement. While much of the assessment research to date has investigated teachers' understandings of assessment purposes, their developing assessment literacy, or specific classroom assessment practices, few studies have explored teachers' differential responses to specific and common classroom assessment scenarios. Drawing on a contemporary view of assessment literacy, and providing empirical evidence for assessment literacy as a differential and situated professional competency, the purpose of this study is to explore teachers' approaches to assessment more closely by examining their differential responses to common classroom assessment scenarios. By drawing on data from 453 beginning teachers who were asked to consider their teaching context and identify their likely actions in response to common assessment scenarios, this paper makes a case for a situated and contextualized view of assessment work, providing an empirically-informed basis for reconceptualizing assessment literacy as negotiated, situated, and differential across teachers, scenarios, and contexts. Data from survey that presents teachers with assessment scenarios are analyzed through descriptive statistics and significance testing to observe similarities and differences by scenario and by participants' teaching division (i.e., elementary and secondary). The paper concludes by considering implications for assessment literacy theory and future related research.},

Recommendations for the improvement of the web-based component of the course are highlighted to provide practical suggestions for instructors to evaluate their own web-based platforms and improve their use of technology in support of AFL.

  abstract = {Assessment literacy is a core professional requirement across educational systems. Hence, measuring and supporting teachers' assessment literacy have been a primary focus over the past two decades. At present, there are a multitude of assessment standards across the world and numerous assessment literacy measures that represent different conceptions of assessment literacy. The purpose of this research is to (a) analyze assessment literacy standards from five English-speaking countries (i.e., Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK, and USA) plus mainland Europe to understand shifts in the assessment landscape over time and across regions and (b) analyze prominent assessment literacy measures developed after 1990. Through a thematic analysis of 15 assessment standards and an examination of eight assessment literacy measures, results indicate noticeable shifts in standards over time yet the majority of measures continue to be based on early conceptions of assessment literacy. Results also serve to define the multiple dimensions of assessment literacy and yield important recommendations for measuring teacher assessment literacy.},

However, recent policy developments, professional standards, and variable assessment education have led to significant variability in teachers' approaches to assessment. The primary purpose of this research was to use a new instrument predicated on recently published classroom assessment standards -- the Approaches to Classroom Assessment Inventory -- to measure teachers' (a) approaches to assessment, (b) perceived skill in current assessment tasks and responsibilities, and (c) professional learning preferences and priorities. Based on 404 teachers from across North America, this study contributes initial evidence of how teachers approach classroom assessment with respect to four dimensions: Assessment Purposes, Assessment Processes, Assessment Fairness and Measurement Theory. Results from this study point to significant differences based on career stage and previous assessment education. The study concludes with four key implications for assessment research and practice.},

  author = {DeLuca, {\relax Christopher}.},

  address = {Kingston, Ont},
  abstract = {Educational programs are typically guided by complex overarching aims that demark broad expectations for program graduates. In practice, these aims tend to become operationalized into specific, measurable learning objectives, which form the basis for assessment of student learning. Research suggests that this practice limits the accuracy and validity of overarching program aims and may result in misrepresentation of student competency. This limitation is in part due to the use of traditional assumptions of measurement that operate on a validity of correspondence that is linear, singular, and value-free. Accordingly, through this research, I construct a framework for understanding the validity of complex program aims by drawing on contemporary validity theory. Specifically, I use an interpretive, argument-based approach to validation to connect, analyse, and evaluate multiple interpretations towards a program's overarching aims. Methodologically, I draw on hermeneutics to collect validity evidence for the construction of a multiple perspective validity argument. I contend that this framework for validation results in a complex articulation of the quality of program coherence between program users' interpretations of complex aims and their practices. In this dissertation, I apply this validation framework to one teacher education program and its aim to promote inclusivity as a fundamental pedagogical principle. In doing so, I provide a complex description of the multiple ways inclusivity is interpreted by diverse program users (i.e., senior program administrators, faculty members, and teacher candidates) and through various program structures. Thus in addition to articulating a validity argument for one teacher education program, this work also contributes a framework of inclusivity towards broader educational discourse.},

  abstract = {Fostering metacognition can be challenging within large enrollment settings, particularly within STEM fields concentrating on problem-solving skills and their underlying theories. Herein, the research problem of realizing more frequent, insightful, and explicitly-rewarded metacognition activities at significant scale is investigated via a strategy utilizing a hierarchy of assessments. Referred to as the STEM-Optimal Digitized Assessment Strategy (SODAS), this targeted approach engages frequent assessment, instructor feedback, and learner self-reflection across the hierarchy of learning mechanisms comprising Bloom's Taxonomy of Learning Domains. SODAS spans this hierarchy of learning mechanisms via a progression of (i) unregulated online assessment, (ii) proctored Computer-Based Assessment (CBA), (iii) problem-based learning activities assessed in the laboratory setting, and (iv) personalized Socratic discussions of scanned scrap sheets that accompanied each learner's machine-graded formative assessments. Results of a case study integrating SODAS within a high-enrollment Mechanical Engineering Heat Transfer course at a large state university are presented for enrollment of 118 students. Six question types were delivered with lockdown proctored testing via auto-grading within the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS), along with bi-weekly laboratory activities to address the higher layers of Bloom's Taxonomy. Sample assessment formats were validated through student use and schedules of responsibilities for instructors across four tiers of assessment levels (facts, concepts, procedures, and metacognition), two testing delivery mechanisms (electronic textbook exercises and proctored CBA), and three remediation mechanisms (self-paced, score clarification, and experiment clarification), which showed that learning achievement can increase by up to 16.9\% compared to conventional assessment strategies, while utilizing comparable instructor resources and workloads.},

The developed group dynamics and students' beliefs about their role during the activity were "revealed" by their reactions to the discussion forum, their private e-mails to the instructor, their activity at the platform and their contribution on the assignment, for which the wiki tool was used. Results indicated that although students were at the same time in-service or pre-service teachers at primary and secondary education and they were expected to implement group work at their teaching, they had low self-efficacy beliefs in using it as students in online learning environment. Their major difficulties were related with their fear about possible negative consequences concerning their marks due to other members' behavior and the lack of experiences. Suggestions on how the group work and the collaborative assignment can be integrated more effectively in an online learning environment in higher education courses are discussed.},

The study is aimed at assessing the utilization of DTs and apps tools by students during the COVID-19 pandemic and how those technologies have affected online learning in institutions of higher education in Ghana. The researcher adopted an online survey and exploratory-based design that utilized quantitative and qualitative approaches to purposively collect data from N=784 students from three major public universities in Ghana. Also, the study applied Uses and Gratification as the theoretical basis in understanding the utilization of DTs and their possible limitations for remote learning during the peak of COVID-19 in Ghana. This study reported that the specific DMTs and mobile apps used by students in higher education for online learning are smarts phones and apps such as Class In, Zoom, Skype, and Instagram live stream. This study also revealed that Personal Learning Network (PLN) such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter were also actively used by students for remote online learning. Again, the study shows that 77.1\% of students in the sampled three universities were fully aware of the DTs and apps utilized for online learning during COVID-19. Also, the findings from this study report that students in higher institutions identified unstable electricity for continuous online learning, especially for those students in rural areas, unreliable internet service, poor WiFi connections, expensive smartphones /laptops, and high cost of inter bundle as key challenges of using DMTs and mobile apps for online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, on the perceived usefulness of DTs and mobile apps among students for online learning in higher educational institutions, the findings from this study suggest that DMT's and apps were of great benefit to students for remote online learning.},

  abstract = {Apprenticeship is an inherently social learning method with a long history of helping novices become experts in various diverse fields. At the center of apprenticeship is the concept of more experienced people assisting less experienced ones, providing structure and examples to support the attainment of goals. However, the overall concept of learning from experts through social interactions is not one that should be relegated to vocational and trade-based training while K-12 and higher educational institutions seek to prepare students for operating in an information-based society. Cognitive apprenticeship--essentially, the use of an apprentice model to support learning in the cognitive domain--is one method that has gained respect and popularity. Scaffolding, modeling, mentoring, and coaching are all methods of teaching and learning that draw on social constructivist learning theory. As such, they promote learning that occurs through social interactions involving negotiation of content, understanding, and learner needs, and, though not the only methods, all three generally are considered forms of cognitive apprenticeship. This chapter first explores prevailing definitions and underlying theories of these teaching and learning strategies and then reviews the state of research in these areas.

  abstract = {In this study, I explore ?blogging?, the use of a regularly updated website or web page, authored and curated by an individual or small group, written in a conversational style, as a form of public pedagogy. I analyse blogs as pre-figurative spaces where people go to learn with/in a public sphere, through collaboration with interested others. However, my intention is not to conceptualize blogging spaces as such, but rather?having framed them in a particular way?to explore the extent to which they globalise dissent. My argument is that the blogs I explore, understood as public pedagogic spaces, cultivate voices of educational dissent. Positioning itself within the global research imagination, the study draws extensively on data generated by two blogging communities with a combined international readership in excess of 40,000 people; one of the blogs is based in the UK, written by a group of adult educators. The other is based in Canada written by a group of adult literacy practitioners. Whilst both blogs are authored, curated and carried by a named individual, as public pedagogic spaces, they are implicated in the creation of a dialogic self: a self which is developed collaboratively with/in the interests of and through a public that coalesces around them. The pedagogies associated with these spaces are argued as explicit and intentioned. The public that coalesces around them learns how to survive a global neoliberal policy nexus that is unsympathetic towards the ideals they pre-figuratively embody. In so doing, they call into being the creation of alternative educational understandings of themselves and each other in relation to policy, pedagogy and the purposes of education.}

They were asked to fill a semi-structured questionnaire at the end of the workshop. Other data came from a rubric used to evaluate VS products from three different points of views (students' self-assessment; university teachers; school teachers). The workshop stimulated the students to use technologies creatively, critically and reflectively to develop an authentic task realizing a VS product. According to the students' opinion, the workshop also facilitated collaborative processes as well as skills of self-assessment and the personalization of learning.},

Defining precisely how students assess the work of others requires careful consideration. Asking the student for numeric grades is the most common method. However, students tend to assign high grades to most projects. Aggregating peer assessments, therefore, results in all projects receiving the same grade. Moreover, students might strategically assign low grades to the projects of others so that their projects will shine. Asking students to order all projects from best to worst imposes a high cognitive load on them, as studies have shown that people find it difficult to order more than a handful of items. To address these issues, we propose a novel peer rating model consisting of (a) an algorithm that elicits student assessments and (b) a protocol for aggregating grades to produce a single order. The algorithm asks students to evaluate projects and answer pairwise comparison queries. These are then aggregated into a ranking over the projects. An application based on our model was deployed and tested in a university course and showed promising results, including fewer ties between alternatives and a significant reduction in the communication load on students. These results indicate that the model provides a simple, accurate, and efficient approach to peer review.},

The revolution in electronic communications of recent decades has given distance education new status. Today more than 10 million of the world's 600 million students study at a distance. Distance education is now a formal form of learning for those in employment, for homemakers and for those who choose not to go to schools or universities. In the corporate sector distance education is fast becoming the preferred type of training. Theoretical Principles of Distance Education highlights for the first time the implications of these developments for both conventional and distance education. The book explores the problems that distance education poses the theorist. In a closely planned and balanced study, fifteen of the world's leading scholars examine the didactic, underpinnings of distance education, making use of contemporary philosophy, educational philosophy and communications theory. The book sets new levels for the analysis and study of distance education.; It demonstrates for the first time that contemporary educational philosophy, didactic strategies and administrative theory can no longer focus solely on the classroom and lecture theatre but must embrace teaching at a distance too.

This study uses Machine Learning techniques and human expert supervision to generate a comprehensive systematic literature mapping review that overcomes some limitations of the traditional ones and provides a broader overview of the content and main topics studied in the specialized literature devoted to MOOCs. The sample consisted of 6320 publications automatically classified within six research topics, denominated by human experts: institutional approach, pedagogical approach, evaluation, analytics, participation, and educational resources. The content analysis of the topics identified was conducted using visual network analysis, which supported the identification of different thematic sub-clusters and endorsed the classification. Results from the review show that the lowest production of MOOC papers is within the topics of the pedagogical approach and educational resources. In contrast, participation and evaluation are the most frequent ones. In addition, the most cited papers are on the topics of analytics and resources, being the pedagogical approach and the institutional approach the less cited. This highlights the need for more MOOC research from a pedagogical perspective and calls upon the presence of educators.},

The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological research study was to explore the experiences instructors had implementing technology in blended learning courses in campus-based institutions of higher education worldwide. This qualitative phenomenological research study used a modified van Kaam method by Moustakas (1994) with in-depth, semi-structured interviews to explore the experiences instructors had implementing technology in blended learning courses. The analysis of the transcribed interviews revealed four themes: (a) facilitates instruction and learning, (b) frustrating, (c) satisfying and rewarding, and (d) socially connecting. The conclusions derived from the study suggest that learning about the experiences instructors had implementing technology in blended learning courses may guide educational leaders in providing support and in preparing professional development workshops on how to teach blended learning courses.},

With a focus on the design and development of an OER-based university-level course, the study identifies and describes features of OERu open design and development processes and compares and contrasts them to similar practices in traditional instructional design and the open source software (OSS) development field. The study was conducted in three parts. First, a detailed description of the OERu project and its explicit purposes, structure and logic models was provided. Second, a review of the literature traced conceptual roots of the OERu in the history of reusable learning objects, open educational resources, sharing of learning design knowledge and OSS development, interwoven with the functions of social processes and mediating artifacts in collaborative design settings. Third, data were collected though interviews with developers and analysis of communications, artifacts and developer contribution histories within the OERu WikiEducator development environment. The study concludes that the goal of enabling achievement of university credit through study of free OER-based courses imposes important considerations on the planning stages of open design and development at both course development team and partner institution levels. Further, attention to community development is key to the success of open design and development in the OERu.},

Patton (2017) summarized 10 pedagogical principles based on the writings of Freire, which he determined relevant as a result of their connection to critical pedagogy of evaluation. We explore a revisioning of those principles: using evaluative thinking to cultivate critical consciousness; learning resides in communities, not just individuals; critical pedagogy must be dialogical and interactive; assessment should integrate reflection, action, thinking, and emotion; and critical consciousness is co-intentional, focusing on process and product. We use them as a framework to describe what we call Freirean principles of assessment, through the application of student blogs within online and distributed assessment practices. Our intention is to share the potential of blogging, in connection with Freirean principles of assessment, when considering open assessment in higher education.},

To find out what facts, just as they stand, mean, is the object of all discovery; to find out what facts will carry out, substantiate, support a given meaning, is the object of all testing. When an inference reaches a satisfactory conclusion, we attain a goal of meaning. The act of judging involves both the growth and the application of meanings. In short, in this chapter we are not introducing a new topic; we are only coming to closer quarters with what hitherto has been constantly assumed.

In the first place thought is used broadly, not to say loosely. Everything that comes to mind, that "goes through our heads," is called a thought. To think of a thing is just to be conscious of it in any way whatsoever. Second, the term is restricted by excluding whatever is directly presented; we think (or think of) only such things as we do not directly see, hear, smell, or taste. Then, third, the meaning is further limited to beliefs that rest upon some kind of evidence or testimony.

This study offers a comprehensive overview of the conditions in which EFA can yield good quality results for N below 50. Simulations were carried out to estimate the minimum required N for different levels of loadings (?), number of factors (f), and number of variables (p) and to examine the extent to which a small N solution can sustain the presence of small distortions such as interfactor correlations, model error, secondary loadings, unequal loadings, and unequal p/f. Factor recovery was assessed in terms of pattern congruence coefficients, factor score correlations, Heywood cases, and the gap size between eigenvalues. A subsampling study was also conducted on a psychological dataset of individuals who filled in a Big Five Inventory via the Internet. Results showed that when data are well conditioned (i.e., high ?, low f, high p), EFA can yield reliable results for N well below 50, even in the presence of small distortions. Such conditions may be uncommon but should certainly not be ruled out in behavioral research data. * These authors contributed equally to this work * These authors contributed equally to this work},

We examined undergraduates' responses to 1198 multiple-choice items on sixteen classroom tests in various disciplines. The mean item discrimination coefficient was +0.25, with more than 30\% of items having unsatisfactory coefficients less than +0.20. Of the 3819 distractors, 45\% were flawed either because less than 5\% of examinees selected them or because their selection was positively rather than negatively correlated with test scores. In three tests, more than 40\% of the items had an unsatisfactory discrimination coefficient, and in six tests, more than half of the distractors were flawed. Discriminatory power suffered dramatically when the selection of one or more distractors was positively correlated with test scores, but it was only minimally affected by the presence of distractors that were selected by less than 5\% of examinees. Our findings indicate that there is considerable room for improvement in the quality of many multiple-choice tests. We suggest that instructors consider improving the quality of their multiple-choice tests by conducting an item analysis and by modifying distractors that impair the discriminatory power of items. Etant donne que les examens a choix multiple sont tellement generalises dans l'enseignement superieur, nous avons effectue une analyse statistique des items utilises dans les examens en classe afin d'en evaluer la qualite. Nous avons analyse les reponses des etudiants de premier cycle a 1198 questions a choix multiples dans 16 examens effectues en classe dans diverses disciplines. Le coefficient moyen de discrimination de l'item etait +0.25. Plus de 30 \% des items avaient des coefficients insatisfaisants inferieurs a + 0.20. Sur les 3819 distracteurs, 45 \% etaient imparfaits parce que moins de 5 \% des etudiants les ont choisis ou a cause d'une correlation negative plutot que positive avec les resultats des examens. Dans trois examens, le coefficient de discrimination de plus de 40 \% des items etait insatisfaisant et dans six examens, plus de la moitie des distracteurs etait imparfaits. Le pouvoir de discrimination etait considerablement affecte en cas de correlation positive entre un distracteur ou plus et les resultatsde l'examen, mais la presence de distracteurs choisis par moins de 5 \% des etudiants avait une influence minime sur ce pouvoir. Nos resultats indiquent que les examens a choix multiple peuvent etre considerablement ameliores. Nous suggerons que les enseignants procedent a une analyse des items et modifient les distracteurs qui compromettent le pouvoir de discrimination des items.},

With the growing popularity of gamification and yet mixed success of its application in educational contexts, the current review is aiming to shed a more realistic light on the research in this field by focusing on empirical evidence rather than on potentialities, beliefs or preferences. Accordingly, it critically examines the advancement in gamifying education. The discussion is structured around the used gamification mechanisms, the gamified subjects, the type of gamified learning activities, and the study goals, with an emphasis on the reliability and validity of the reported outcomes. To improve our understanding and offer a more realistic picture of the progress of gamification in education, consistent with the presented evidence, we examine both the outcomes reported in the papers and how they have been obtained. While the gamification in education is still a growing phenomenon, the review reveals that (i) insufficient evidence exists to support the long-term benefits of gamification in educational contexts; (ii) the practice of gamifying learning has outpaced researchers' understanding of its mechanisms and methods; (iii) the knowledge of how to gamify an activity in accordance with the specifics of the educational context is still limited. The review highlights the need for systematically designed studies and rigorously tested approaches confirming the educational benefits of gamification, if gamified learning is to become a recognized instructional approach.},

  abstract = {This communication describes a variety of virtual student assessment strategies employed at the University of Toronto during the academic disruption caused by the 2020 COVID-19 global pandemic. Instructors focused their efforts toward maintaining a positive learning environment and offering meaningful evaluation methods for students in each of three introductory organic chemistry courses. Assessment schemes were initially modified in response to moving courses to a virtual platform, and a variety of support measures were used while students completed the course material and prepared for online ``final assignments'', which in two courses included a virtual rehearsal test. The readiness for and delivery of online final assignments is outlined (including methods to effectively maintain academic integrity), and the important roles of graduate student teaching assistants in successfully completing each course are highlighted. Specific outcomes and reflections are discussed, including approaches which, with hindsight, were considered unnecessary, and others that proved to be valuable virtual teaching and assessment tools.},

  abstract = {In the past 20 years there has been a dramatic increase in adults desiring to change careers, and a great number of these adults are transitioning to careers in teaching. To meet the needs of these adult learners, there is an increasing desire and need for online learning, particularly for the adult learner who continues to work full time while pursuing a teaching license. Recognizing that institutions of higher education--particularly private institutions--do not have limitless fiscal and human resources, there is a need to appropriately invest in instructor resources in order to provide the most effective and efficient learning environment for career changers. This current study surveyed career changers in a College of Education at a Midwestern institution on the behaviors of course instructors they value most and value least in the online learning atmosphere. The career changers noted that they highly value effective communication, feedback, and a positive disposition from online course instructors. Recognizing that career changers valued these three behaviors the most, universities need to inform faculty about the importance of ongoing communication, providing meaningful feedback, and designing explicit strategies to provide encouragement within the online learning management system. Career changers have many options for online teacher preparation programs; therefore, universities need to distinguish themselves by offering high quality, pedagogically-sound programs that are also responsive to the career changers' desires and needs.},

They are inducted into fact checking, editing and creating Wikipedia articles as a means to analyse source material critically and to advance their research, writing and digital literacy. Meanwhile, in a postgraduate course in magazine studies, instead of writing essays, students are promoting Australian magazines and print culture by writing Wikipedia entries about Antipodean magazines and their editors. These courses experiment with new approaches to formative and summative assessment; promote group research, collaborative and participatory writing, writing across networks and negotiating discourse communities; and challenge students' perceptions about peer review and the legitimacy of Wikipedia.},

Such projects, and the edit-a-thons that continue to be convened in Wadewitz's honour, help to reconcile the imbalance and simultaneously present pedagogical opportunities. Drawing upon scholarly literature, this paper also illustrates how Wikipedia editing supports and reinforces the principles of both academic and public writing and represents an open and sustainable platform for formative and summative assessment.

E-assessment, as prepared and administered with the use of ICT, provides opportunities to make the process easier in some aspects, but also brings certain challenges. This paper presents an e-assessment framework from a student perspective. Our study lasted for one academic year and incorporated a total of 631 students' responses to questionnaires conducted three times in two different mathematics courses. The courses are compulsory for undergraduate informatics students. The research included a three-step factor analysis: two exploratory factor analyses and a confirmatory factor analysis. It yielded a model of a student perspective on e-assessment consisting of four factors: Transparency and fairness of assessment, Formative and summative assessment and feedback, Meaningful use of technology in assessment and Difficulty of learning outcomes. The students' opinion about the use of e-assessment was generally positive. The students appreciated the student-centred approach based on sound pedagogical alignment of all teaching and learning elements with assessment. They found it important that technology should not distract students during assessment tasks and considered cheating in a controlled e-assessment environment to be no more frequent than in face-to-face assessment.},

  abstract = {Flipped classroom (FC) approaches have gotten substantial attention in the last decade because they have a potential to stimulate student engagement as well as active and collaborative learning. The FC is generally defined as a strategy that flips the traditional education setting, i.e., the information transmission component of a traditional face-to-face lecture is moved out of class time. The FC relies on technology and is therefore suitable for online or blended learning, which were predominant forms of learning during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020--July 2021). In this paper we present a systematic literature review (SLR) of studies that covered online FC approaches in higher education during the pandemic. We analyzed 205 publications in total and 18 in detail. Our research questions were related to the main findings about the success of implementation of online FC and recommendations for future research. The findings indicated that those who had used FC approaches in face-to-face or blended learning environments more successfully continued to use them in online environments than those who had not used it before. The SLR opened possible questions for future research, such as the effectiveness of the FC for different courses and contexts, the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement, and students' data protection. It pointed to the need to examine different aspects of online delivery of the FC more comprehensively, and with more research rigor.},

This research analysed the case of a massive distance learning university that rapidly changed the final assessment (N=126,653 undergraduate students in 2020) from face-to-face exams to entirely online exams. The research focused on the influence of online assessment on academic performance and students' perception of the new method. Two data sources were used: the contrast of academic performance indicators (assessment, success and achievement rates, and average marks obtained) between the online examination call and the previous ones with face-to-face examinations; and a questionnaire to a sample of students (n=714) on their perception of the online assessment experience. The results show that all the academic performance indicators in the 28 Bachelor Degrees offered at the university increased when the final assessment method turned to online due to the pandemic crisis; and that a majority of students are more favourable to online assessment methods. The discussion places these findings in a context of rapid change, and concludes by identifying the possible implications of online assessment for student retention, organisational challenges, as well as possible further studies.},

Each course is provided in three delivery modes and mapped to Ireland's National Professional Development Framework for teachers. This enables multiple access points for teachers to engage in professional development via the Framework and recognize their engagement through peer triads and a digital badge ecosystem. The paper critically discusses and reflects on the study of the complex phenomena of the application of the open courses within professional contexts. A novel dimension is the implementation of a peer triad system for recognition of PD. Implementing the open courses digital badges ecosystem was challenging as this different form of assessment required a clear understanding of all stakeholder expectations, the language of recognition and how the learning outcomes could be met and validated using a peer triad assessment. This paper concludes with sectoral learning on nationally recognized open course development, including success factors for building digital capacity, challenges encountered and transferability to other contexts.},

Many studies have examined the effects of scaffolding with diverse groups of participants, purposes, learning outcomes, and learning environments. The purpose of this research was to conduct a meta-analysis of the effects of scaffolding on learning outcomes in an online learning environment in higher education. This meta-analysis included studies with 64 effect sizes from 18 journal articles published in English, in eight countries, from 2010 to 2019. The meta-analysis revealed that scaffolding in an online learning environment has a large and statistically significant effect on learning outcomes. The meta-cognitive domain yielded a larger effect size than did the affective and cognitive domains. In terms of types of scaffolding activities, meta-cognitive scaffolding outnumbered other types of scaffolding. Computers as a scaffolding source in an online learning environment were also more prevalent than were human instructors. In addition, scholars in the United States have produced a large portion of the scaffolding research. Finally, the academic area of language and literature has adopted scaffolding most widely. Given that effective scaffolding can improve the quality of learning in an online environment, the current research is expected to contribute to online learning outcomes and learning experiences.},

  abstract = {Teacher and student perceptions of using technology enhanced learning (TEL) in higher education have received growing attention, particularly during COVID-19, however existing studies are mainly disciplinespecific. This study adopts a holistic cross-disciplinary approach. It compares teacher and student perceptions on defining TEL, promotors and barriers for its use, and solutions offered for better use of TEL in the future. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected from an Australian university. A total of 75 teachers and 48 students completed an online survey, and of these participants, 24 teachers and 29 students participated in follow-up focus group interviews that included Kahoot! surveys. Quantitative results show that teacher and student perceptions on TEL were generally aligned except that self-reported technology savviness and confidence was rated higher than how students and staff rated each other. Qualitative analyses reveal that both teachers and students identified the main promoters for TEL as being: modern and expected in higher education, while being equalising, efficient, engaging, authentic, collaborative and flexible. The common barriers for using TEL were identified as fear, time, organisational culture, knowledge and technical/support issues, along with the perceived pitfalls of distraction, and superficial student learning. Solutions offered for TEL in the future from staff focused on the institution and a desire for strategic, pedagogical and holistic approaches, while students focussed on the accessibility, flexibility and collaborative potential of TEL. This cross-discipline pre-COVID-19 study of TEL perceptions offered by teachers and students has contributed to knowledge in this area by identifying barriers and solutions for TEL common to all disciplines that have the potential to be applied to whole of institution strategic approaches for the more effective use of TEL in teaching and learning in higher education. Student accessibility to TEL and the development of pedagogically sound digital learning resources bringing together educational developers and discipline experts are of particular relevance during and post-COVID-19.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this research was to study the effects of violations of standard multiple-choice item writing principles on test characteristics, student scores, and pass--fail outcomes. Four basic science examinations, administered to year-one and year-two medical students, were randomly selected for study. Test items were classified as either standard or flawed by three independent raters, blinded to all item performance data. Flawed test questions violated one or more standard principles of effective item writing. Thirty-six to sixty-five percent of the items on the four tests were flawed. Flawed items were 0--15 percentage points more difficult than standard items measuring the same construct. Over all four examinations, 646 (53\%) students passed the standard items while 575 (47\%) passed the flawed items. The median passing rate difference between flawed and standard items was 3.5 percentage points, but ranged from -1 to 35 percentage points. Item flaws had little effect on test score reliability or other psychometric quality indices. Results showed that flawed multiple-choice test items, which violate well established and evidence-based principles of effective item writing, disadvantage some medical students. Item flaws introduce the systematic error of construct-irrelevant variance to assessments, thereby reducing the validity evidence for examinations and penalizing some examinees.},

'Catalytic Assessment: Understanding how MCQs and EVS can Foster Deep Learning.' "British Journal of Educational Technology" 40 (2): 285-293.]. However, within the discourse exploring staff-student co-creation, some concerns have been raised about whether students ought to, or indeed can, meaningfully act as partners in assessment [Cook-Sather, Bovill, and Felten 2014. "Engaging Students as Partners in Learning and Teaching." San~Francisco, CA: Jossey Bass.]. This paper describes the introduction of a co-creation assignment into an undergraduate tax module. Students' and instructors' perceptions of several aspects of the assignment were examined, facilitating the cataloguing and elucidation of the tensions involved in assessment co-creation. The paper suggests techniques to manage these challenges effectively, thereby providing a case study for others with an interest in implementing assessment co-creation within their own disciplinary context.},

The researchers utilized the adapted Turkish version of OPV to collect and used Online Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (OIPA) to analyze the data. Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) grounded in EST constructed the theoretical framework for the research. In total, 115 participants completed and consented for the study. Sixteen main "facilitator-related themes" emerged, and the five most expressed were having technology (n = 31, 35\%), internet (n = 28, 32\%), communication (n =18, 20\%), emotions (n = 17, 19\%), and economic resources (n = 16, \%18). Thirteen main complicators"-related themes" emerged, and the five most reported barriers were lacks of technological resources (n = 41, 47\%), internet (n = 40, 46\%), appropriate learning environments, learning opportunities (n = 32, 36\%) appropriate resources for online or distance education (n = 18, 20\%), and interaction (n = 14, 16\%). Participants attributed the facilitator and complicators to EST levels respectively as follows: individual/intrapsychic factors (84\%; 69\%), microsystem (45\%; 59\%), exosystem (36\%; 43\%), and macrosystem (34\%; 44\%). The researchers provided practical recommendations. The researchers obtained an institutional review board approval for this study.},

In this paper we report on how this problem evolves and presents itself, and describe progress we have been making to reduce the distance, notably through Athabasca Landing, a social construction kit and shared informal and formal learning environment intended to fill some of the gaps. In the process, we extend and develop the notion of transactional distance to describe how it applies outside the closed formal groups of intentional learning into network, set and collective contexts.},

  abstract = {Background It is important for institutions of higher education to maintain academic integrity, both for students and the institutions themselves. Proctoring is one way of accomplishing this, and with the increasing popularity of online courses---along with the sudden shift to online education sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic---digital proctoring has seen an increase in use. However, there are privacy and bias concerns related to digital proctoring, so it is important to critically examine its role in higher education---when it should and should not be used, and how it is perceived among those who interact with it. Objectives In this paper, we: examine the features of and concerns about digital proctoring; analyse the results of a survey regarding student and teaching assistant (TA) attitudes towards digital proctoring; and present alternatives to digital proctoring and a framework for evaluating the need for a digital proctoring tool. Methods We surveyed students and TAs in an online graduate computer science program, asking them to provide their agreement or disagreement with 20 statements related to digital proctoring. For each response option on each statement, we calculated overall percentages as well as percentages broken out by demographics. We compared these percentages to develop a picture of student and TA perceptions. Results and Conclusions Students and TAs alike are generally tolerant of digital proctoring software and perceive some benefits to using it, including adding integrity to course grades and value to degree programs. However, they have some concerns in the areas of privacy, equity, and technical difficulties. Takeaways Digital proctoring software should be used only when necessary, with thought devoted to its impact on students and TAs and any concerns they may have. There exist alternative methods for maintaining academic integrity in a course. The framework we have presented can help with determining the need for digital proctoring. Lay Description Current Knowledge Digital proctoring is increasing in usage, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Students are more likely to cheat in un-proctored environments. There are privacy and equity concerns related to the use of digital proctoring software. Not much research exists on student and teaching assistant attitudes towards digital proctoring. Our Contributions We define the features that most digital proctoring tools share and articulate their benefits and drawbacks. We present the results of a survey about student and teaching assistant attitudes towards digital proctoring. We provide alternative methods for maintaining academic integrity focusing on assessment design and administration. We provide a framework for determining whether it is necessary to use digital proctoring in a course. Implications of Findings Digital proctoring should only be used when absolutely necessary. Students and teaching assistants are generally positive about the use of digital proctoring. Concerns about privacy, bias, and technical difficulties should be considered when using digital proctoring.},

In reality, a limited body of scientifically based empirical evidence exists to support that formative assessment directly contributes to positive educational outcomes. The use of formative assessments, or other diagnostic efforts within classrooms, provides information that should help facilitate improved pedagogical practices and instructional outcomes. However, a review of the formative assessment literature revealed that there is no agreed upon lexicon with regard to formative assessment and suspect methodological approaches in the efforts to demonstrate positive effects that could be attributed to formative assessments. Thus, the purpose of this article was two-fold. First, the authors set out to clarify the terminology related to formative assessment and its usage. Finally, the article provides a critical analysis of the seminal literature on formative assessment, beginning with Black and Wiliam (1998), and extending through current published materials.},

  abstract = {Based on a critical review of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), this study first formalized an alternative theoretical model for explaining the acceptance and use of information system (IS) and information technology (IT) innovations. The revised theoretical model was then empirically examined using a combination of meta-analysis and structural equation modelling (MASEM) techniques. The meta-analysis was based on 1600 observations on 21 relationships coded from 162 prior studies on IS/IT acceptance and use. The SEM analysis showed that attitude: was central to behavioural intentions and usage behaviours, partially mediated the effects of exogenous constructs on behavioural intentions, and had a direct influence on usage behaviours. A number of implications for theory and practice are derived based on the findings.},

This purpose of this paper is two-fold: first, it describes how weekly web conferences that were offered for online initial teacher education students (ITES) were designed with due consideration for Timperley's enablers for professional conversations; and second, it reports on student experiences of the ways in which the web conferences served to support professional conversations. In order to understand the complex and multifaceted ways that web conferences served to facilitate ITES engagement in professional conversations, data is drawn from thirty-two online ITES enrolled in a capstone unit in their final semester of study in a teacher education course. Using a descriptive mixed-methods case study approach, the ITES completed questionnaires, participated in follow-up interviews and completed their assessment tasks to shed insight into the impact of the web conferences. The findings reveal the powerful ways that the web conferences allowed the students to participate in meaningful professional conversations and helped develop the professional attributes expected of graduates. Importantly, the study revealed that ITES perceived that the web conferences prompted a deeper level of engagement, satisfaction and sense of achievement than alternative activities, including face-to-face tutorials.},

The study comprises a three-year investigation on the attitudes and understandings of students prior to a group work assessment task, and after completing the online tutorial. First year primary education students (n = 594) completed pre- and post-surveys on their perspective of working with others, with a moderating educational intervention. Results revealed mixed views about the value of the program to this generation of students.

The case demonstrates an ongoing balancing act between the demands of reliability and validity, and resulted in the development of a Teacher Assessment Seesaw, which provides a model for both interpreting and supporting practice, within and beyond primary science.}

  abstract = {Classroom assessment is purposeful when the information is utilised by teachers to support learning. Such formative assessment practices can be difficult to enact in a primary science classroom, with the whole class often involved in practical activities and with limited lesson time. This preliminary study seeks to explore formative decision-making and the subsequent actions taken by teachers in the classroom. Primary teachers who used a Teacher Assessment in Primary Science (TAPS) Focused Assessment activity were asked to describe what action they took as a result of the classroom interactions stimulated by the activity. 142 teachers in 9 regions of England completed a paper questionnaire at a training day. The qualitative data pertinent to the study was extracted and thematic content analysis carried out to determine the kinds of actions and changes to practice that were described. It was found that the `next step' described by teachers varied in timing; some made changes within the lesson, others provided follow up activities or made longer-term adaptation to teaching practices. Being responsive to the assessment information provided by the children took many forms, for example, supporting pupils to reflect on investigations during the lesson, discussing vocabulary or concepts, providing time for further exploration, or explicit modelling of science skills. Formative decisions were taken at a whole class level, rather than making individual adaptations. It is argued that enabling teachers to be more explicit about their tacit decision-making could support them to make more formative use of assessment information to support pupil learning.}

  abstract = {Assessment drives the taught curriculum, defines what is valued (Stobart 2008) and can enhance or hinder learning (Mansell et al. 2009). In England, the complexities of assessment are compounded by ongoing changes to statutory assessment procedures and a lack of centralised guidance for judgements of primary science (Turner et al. 2013). The Nuffield expert group (2012) proposed a pyramid-shaped model of teacher assessment which utilised formative information to inform summative judgements. The model was operationalised by the Teacher Assessment in Primary Science (TAPS) project (Davies et al. 2014), but there was no explicit explanation of the 'formative to summative' process. This study sought to develop understanding of the relationship between formative and summative teacher assessment of primary science, in action and over time. A Design-Based Research (DBR) approach was used in order to develop guidance directly relevant to practice. Analysis of 91 submissions from the Primary Science Quality Mark (PSQM) database provided a mapping of current practice in England. Two case studies of TAPS project schools considered the enacted relationship between formative and summative assessment, during implementation of a 'formative to summative' approach. New insights have been gained into the conceptualisation and enactment of the relationship between formative and summative assessment. Teacher conceptualisations of assessment were found to encapsulate a wide range of dimensions such as purpose, value, audience, assessor, timing, formality, rigidity and support. Refinements to the TAPS pyramid model are proposed to explain the 'formative to summative' process, conceptualising summative assessment as a summary judgement of attainment, which may be informed by snapshot and focused assessment activities. It was found that implementation of a 'formative to summative' approach required a shared understanding of key assessment concepts like validity and reliability; a seesaw balance model is proposed to support the development of such a shared understanding.},

In particular, we discuss why it may not make sense for Canadian schools to try to adopt the American honour code model. We explore the evolution of higher education in Canada, highlighting the earliest incidents of academic misconduct on record as well as the development of academic integrity scholarship, focusing on significant contributions and its impact over time. In particular, we draw attention to the emergence of policies, practices, associations, and networks intended to help Canada's higher educational institutions develop and strengthen cultures of integrity. Following, we discuss how the academic integrity landscape has shifted, noting recent trends such as the rise of contract cheating. We conclude with a call to action for more enhanced support for academic integrity scholarship to support advocacy, policy, and practice.},

Whether through the use of post, radio, television and digital technologies, extending learning opportunities to more and a wider range of people has been a significant aspect of educational history. Transcending barriers to learning has been promoted as the means of opening educational opportunities in highly normative ways, focusing on the media through which to remove the limits of institutional selection, and of space and time. While there is an obvious attractiveness is such notions, they do little to engage with the critical research on the selectiveness and exclusions inherent in all curricula and pedagogic approaches, however open. The nature, scale and range of digital technologies have seen resurgent interest in the possibilities of openness in education. However, these technologies work on the basis of ontologies, code, algorithms and standards to build knowledge infrastructures that are not always open or opening.

  abstract = {The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic in 2020 has had a lasting impact on all areas of personal life. However, the political, economic, legal and healthcare system, as well as the education system have also experienced the effects. Universities had to face new challenges and requirements in teaching and examinations as quickly as possible in order to be able to guarantee high-quality education for their students. This study aims to examine how the German-speaking medical faculties of the Umbrella Consortium of Assessment Network (UCAN) have dealt with the challenges but also the opportunities that the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic created in medical education and whether digitalisation has been driven forward as a result. In an initial online-survey we focused our questions on the current teaching situation with regard to digitised teaching content, the support or establishment of adequate framework conditions by the medical faculties and IT facilities and also the execution of examinations during the summer semester 2020. Between August and September 2020, a total of 88 examiners, educators, dean of study and/or technical admins from 32 partner faculties took part in the survey. Students were not included in our survey. Most respondents stated that a switch to a digital semester had worked, the use of e-learning increased compared to previous semesters and that most courses could be converted, with the exception of practical courses, which were largely cancelled. The respondents also indicated that most examinations could still be taken, with the exception of~practical examination formats, like Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs). However, in the case of face-to-face examinations, strict distance and hygiene conditions had to be obeyed or there had to be a switch to distance-online examinations, which raised many open issues such as equal opportunities of students (technical equipment, internet access, premises) and attempts at deception (third-party help with the exam, mutual exchange between students, web search). In conclusion, we identified several issues regarding the rapid transition to a digital semester due to COVID-19 which were categorised into the following topics: Face-to-face teaching could not take place, (2) know-how of educators, (3) integrity aspects, (4) technical aspects, (5) additional personnel required, (6) additional time and effort required for implementation of digital teaching. Our study shows that a switch to digital teaching and distance online examinations is feasible, but many problems were encountered concerning academic integrity and basic ethical principles still need to be solved. In order to investigate whether above mentioned issued could be solved one year after the transition to a digital semester, we conducted a second survey in which the 32 initially surveyed institutions were questioned again.},

  abstract = {More and more educational scenarios and learning landscapes are developed using blogs, wikis, podcasts and e-portfolios. Web 2.0 tools give learners more control, by allowing them to easily create, share or reuse their own learning materials, and these tools also enable social learning networks that bridge the border between formal and informal learning. However, practices of strategic innovation of universities, faculty development, assessment, evaluation and quality assurance have not fully accommodated these changes in technology and teaching. Ehlers and Schneckenberg present strategic approaches for innovation in universities. The contributions explore new models for developing and engaging faculty in technology-enhanced education, and they detail underlying reasons for why quality assessment and evaluation in new -- and often informal -- learning scenarios have to change. Their book is a practical guide for educators, aimed at answering these questions. It describes what E-learning 2.0 is, which basic elements of Web 2.0 it builds on, and how E-learning 2.0 differs from Learning 1.0. The book also details a number of quality methods and examples, such as self-assessment, peer-review, social recommendation, and peer-learning, using illustrative cases and giving practical recommendations. Overall, it offers a step-by-step guide for educators so that they can choose their own quality assurance or assessment methods, or develop their own evaluation methodology for specific learning scenarios. The book addresses everyone involved in higher education -- university leaders, chief information officers, change and quality assurance managers, and faculty developers. Pedagogical advisers and consultants will find new insights and practices for the integration and management of novel learning technologies in higher education. The volume fosters in lecturers and teachers a sound understanding of the need and strategy for change, and it provides them with practical recommendations on competence and quality methodologies.},

We describe how these were derived based on an extensive survey and analysis of OER case studies. The article focuses on three aspects: First it provides a working definition of open educational practices and articulates how better understanding of OEP might lead to enhancements in both quality and innovation in education. Secondly it is discusses the ways in which adopting more `open' approaches to educational practices might impact on the quality of education. Thirdly, the case study findings are presented and the ways in which the different stakeholders involved influence open educational practices are discussed.}

This paper reports on a program designed to improve the collegial culture at a higher educational organization in Western Canada.

With the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, like ChatGPT, potential risks related to cheating and plagiarism have increased. This study aims to investigate the authenticity capabilities of ChatGPT models 3.5 and 4 in generating novel, coherent, and accurate responses that evade detection by text-matching software. The repeatability and reproducibility of both models were analyzed, showing that the generation of responses remains consistent. However, a two-sample t-test revealed insufficient evidence to support a statistically significant difference between the text-matching percentages of both models. Several strategies are proposed to address the challenges posed by AI integration in academic contexts; one probable solution is to promote self-transcendent ideals by implementing honor codes. It is also necessary to consider the restricted knowledge base of AI language models like GPT and address any inaccuracies in generated references. Additionally, designing assignments that extract data from imaged sources and integrating oral discussions into the evaluation process can mitigate the challenges posed by AI integration. However, educators should carefully consider the practical constraints and explore alternative assessment methods to prevent academic misconduct while reaping the benefits of these strategies.},

Combining research methodologies from student approaches to learning and social network analysis, the results reveal evidence of different collaborative patterns across the population sample. The investigation uncovers contrasting groupings of students with deep and surface approaches to inquiry and to online learning technologies, positive and negative conceptions of the learning environment, and relatively higher or lower academic outcomes. These are discovered to logically relate to different collaborative patterns. The most effective collaboration strategies involve collaborating only as much as tasks needed, in smaller groups, and being reciprocal by accepting and inviting peers to work together. Effective collaboration strategies also include students positioning themselves to gather information easily in their collaboration networks and to develop closely knit collaborative groups. The results offer an evidence-base to identify different experiences of student learning and collaboration to improve program design and the attribute of collaboration, and to improve the concepts underpinning policy development for quality improvement of university graduates.},

However, there are still challenges regarding how to accurately assess this skill through traditional student learning measures. To better understand the nature of effective collaboration of university students in blended courses, the current study drew on the student approaches to learning framework and social network analysis techniques. We examined how student approaches to inquiry, approaches to online learning technologies, perceptions of the blended learning environment, different learning outcomes and configurations of collaboration are related. The methodologies commonly used in student approaches to learning research identified deep and surface approaches to inquiry and technologies, positive and negative perceptions of the integration of the learning environment, and of online workload, which also showed logical alignment with relatively better and poorer academic achievement in the course. Based on approaches, perceptions, and learning outcomes, students were divided into groups orientated towards understanding versus reproducing learning. The social network analysis techniques revealed features of different configurations of collaborations by different groups of students and their choices as to whether and with whom to collaborate during the learning process. Nuanced differences were found amongst different configurations of collaborations. [Author abstract]},

A comprehensive survey of educational psychology texts was completed to identify the textbook authors' recommended guidelines for teachers to follow when writing multiple-choice test items. Next, a reduced set of 12 guidelines was identified on the basis of the frequency of author recommendations. These 12 guidelines were used to evaluate 60 multiple-choice items (N = 1,080) that were randomly selected from 18 different instructor guides to introductory educational psychology texts.

  abstract = {Feedback on student work is a key mechanism for improving learning in higher education (HE) and can be provided in a variety of forms. Recently, many institutions have moved to the provision of electronic feedback, although evidence for the effectiveness of this is mixed. While many studies evaluating the students' perception of feedback are now available, there is little evidence of contrasting perceptions of its value according to different disciplines. This work aims to evaluate the relationship between students' expectations and perception of feedback, especially electronic, and the disciplinary area of study in HE. Students (n~=~1017) across different courses from a post-1992 university in the UK were surveyed and categorised into five disciplinary clusters: Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics; Business and Accounting; Art and Design; Media and Languages; and Psychology and Social Care. Perceived relevance as well as the most pertinent features and expectations of the quality of electronic feedback for students varies according to disciplinary cluster and thus closely aligns with a specific cluster's learning and teaching practices. The findings of this study may help institutions to reflect on the role of electronic feedback as part of their ongoing assessment practice and how teaching in the different disciplines may result in different understandings of the value of electronic feedback.},

In this chapter I present an integrated and interactive framework for construct validity based on the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (2014) to articulate the potential impact of cognitive-based approaches to item and test design. I then apply this framework to an alternative form of a fluid intelligence test developed with automatically generated items and demonstrate, through various types of empirical evidence, that the construct validity of this test is supported.},

But other studies have indicated that these effects are mediated by the students' own perceptions of those environments. Here two studies are reported which explore the relationships between approaches to learning, or study orientations, and perceptions of the academic environment. Those perceptions are measured in two distinct ways, one which minimises the effects of differential perceptions, and one which highlights them. Factor analyses of the responses of three groups of students taking engineering and psychology are used to clarify the nature of the relationships between study orientations and perceptions of the academic environment. It is found, as in earlier studies, that there are relationships which associate deep approaches with perceptions of relevance, and surface approaches with a heavy workload. But here it is also shown that students with contrasting study orientations are likely to define effective teaching in ways which reflect those orientations. Implications both for the design of feedback questionnaires and for the improvement of teaching and learning in higher education are discussed.},

Traditionally these have emerged from a combination of mainstream psychology and personal experience. More recently concepts have been derived from the qualitative analysis of students' experiences of studying and subsequently operationalised through inventories. This study compares the dimensions emerging from these two contrasting approaches. A sample of 218 mainly first-year university students were given shortened versions of two inventories, one based on concepts from cognitive psychology and the other from educational research. Correlations between subscales from the two inventories, and factor analyses of them, are reported which show substantial agreement between the main concepts used from the two theoretical traditions to describe study strategies.}

Software developers use version control systems for collaborative coding. These systems are integrated into several software development platforms (including GitLab and GitHub) which support additional software engineering functionalities. Using these platforms in an educational context allows students to gain skills relevant to industry, whilst providing a means of keeping track of their activities. In this paper, we investigate the effect of presenting teams of students with GitLab metrics about their performance at coursework consultation sessions (checkpoint sessions), with a particular focus on the number of issues assigned and completed, and the number of commits made to the repository. A comparative analysis of project marks in two consecutive academic years indicates that these checkpoint sessions may lead to better student outcomes. An interview study with students and teaching assistants identified viewing the GitLab metrics in the checkpoints as an opportunity to see the relative contributions of team members and address resulting issues, and as a catalyst for improving engagement with the team project. The study also identified drawbacks of using the metrics too simplistically, and suggested that it was important to consider the quality and amount of written code, as well as the number of times someone committed to the repository.},

Ten volunteering prospective visual-art teachers were involved in the study during 2013-2014 academic year. Focus group interviews were conducted with the participants to collect data in addition to online digital documents, including photographs of students' paintings and comments on them. In general, participants stated that Facebook-based peer assessment is beneficial, since it helps them notice their deficiencies, look at their works from a different perspective and improve their artistic skills. Thanks to the productive feedback, their motivation and self-confidence are boosted. It was also found that peer-assessment on Facebook has the advantage of ubiquity, allowing more peer involvement, easy and objective criticism, and sustainable learning opportunities in the long-run. The participants also emphasized some disadvantages of the practice of peer assessment on Facebook such as subjective feedback and poor quality of digitalized visuals.},

Learning theories provide instructional designers with verified instructional strategies and techniques for facilitating learning as well as a foundation for intelligent strategy selection. Yet many designers are operating under the constraints of a limited theoretical background. This paper is an attempt to familiarize designers with three relevant positions on learning (behavioral, cognitive, and constructivist) which provide structured foundations for planning and conducting instructional design activities. Each learning perspective is discussed in terms of its specific interpretation of the learning process and the resulting implications for instructional designers and educational practitioners. The information presented here provides the reader with a comparison of these three different viewpoints and illustrates how these differences might be translated into practical applications in instructional situations.},

The answers to these questions will shape how our discipline chooses to reward academics who engage with ``new media'' such as blogs, online seminars (i.e., webinars), Twitter, and Facebook. We find that traditional tools of scholarship are more highly regarded and used more often than any new media, although blogs are considered most important among new media. However, we also find evidence that these webinars are used and valued at rates comparable to traditional tools when they are provided in ways that meet political scientists' needs. Finally, we observe that women and graduate students are substantially more likely than men and tenure-track academics to report that webinars and online videos are important sources of new ideas and findings.}

Design/methodology/approach               The study is a cross-sectional survey conducted at the Department of Educational Innovations at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology from March to June 2020. The purposive sampling technique was used to sample 100 postgraduate students who registered for a course in the department. The data for the study were collected using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and 17-item self-administered eQuestionnaire. Multiple Linear Regression analysis, ANOVA, Independent sample T-test and Mann--Whitney U-test were used to estimate the differences in course achievements of students who experienced education through audio teleconferencing and those who experienced education through video teleconferencing.                                         Findings                                In total, 59\% of the participating postgraduate students chose to attend the synchronous online lectures via audio teleconferencing (dial-in). The participants gave a high SUS score (SUS\,{$>$}\,80.3; Grade A; Excellent) for audio conferencing service. Among the students in the audio teleconferencing cohort, the results evidenced a strong positive linear correlation, (r (57)\,=\,0.79, p\,{$<$}\,0.05), between the individual adjective ratings and the SUS scores. There was marginal significance among demography of students in the audio teleconference (AT) cohort with regards to their perception about the dial-in lecture. There was no statistically significant difference, (                 t                 (98)\,=\,1.88, p\,=\,0.063), in the achievement test for AT students and video teleconference (VT) students. The instructors and the students were satisfied with the AT.                                                        Practical implications               Based on the students' preference, AT offers equal benefit as VT with regards to system satisfaction and perceived quality of online teaching. AT, as teaching modality, should be an option for students who reside in communities with high latency internet connectivity. It is recommended that instructors are trained on how to engage and motivate students via AT.                                         Originality/value               Higher education institutions in Ghana are facing decisions about how to continue learning and teaching through flexible pedagogy, while keeping their faculty members and students protected from the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of these institutions have canceled the brick-and-mortar education and other conventional learning practices and have instructed faculty to adopt online teaching through synchronous video teleconferencing platforms. However, the learning experience is not the same for students who reside in remote or rural communities with low bandwidth. There is very little research in this topic, especially in developing countries like Ghana, and the present study aims to bridge the gap in the literature by exploring the characteristics and potential effects of teaching and learning through audio teleconferencing (dial-in) with a cell phone, in the context of a 12-week postgraduate course.},

Initially, both groups were given the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale and a pretest of speaking. In the treatment phase, the InV.G was asked to narrate a video and received instructions on their errors. The InA.G narrated the video while being provided with scaffolding during narration. Then both groups were given a posttest and, two weeks later, a delayed posttest. The results indicated that both groups' oral performance significantly increased, while their anxiety reduced. In the end, a semi-structured interview was conducted whose results revealed that the InA.G experienced more anxiety mostly due to feeling a sense of interruption and losing face.},

  abstract = {Abstract   Notwithstanding the proliferation of servant leadership studies with over 100 articles published in the last four years alone, a lack of coherence and clarity around the construct has impeded its theory development. We provide an integrative and comprehensive review of the 285 articles on servant leadership spanning 20\,years (1998--2018), and in so doing extend the field in four different ways. First, we provide a conceptual clarity of servant leadership vis-a-vis other value-based leadership approaches and offer a new definition of servant leadership. Second, we evaluate 16 existing measures of servant leadership in light of their respective rigor of scale construction and validation. Third, we map the theoretical and nomological network of servant leadership in relation to its antecedents, outcomes, moderators, mediators. We finally conclude by presenting a detailed future research agenda to bring the field forward encompassing both theoretical and empirical advancement. All in all, our review paints a holistic picture of where the literature has been and where it should go into the future.}

The objective of this study is to assess students' CT skills in terms of cognitive style by implementing the problem-based e-learning (e-PBL) model in mathematics courses. This study is an evaluative study with an experimental approach, where as many as 28 students as research samples were taken purposively from Mandalika University of Education, Indonesia. A set of instruments was prepared to measure every aspect of CT and cognitive style, including descriptive and statistical data analysis so that the results of the CT assessment were found. In general, the results of the CT evaluation show that e-PBL is effective in improving students' CT skills, so this is a recommendation to use e-PBL widely and intensively.},

The need for assessment literacy based on measurement and quantitative data is weakening, both in terms of the traditional approach of the assessment on which it is based on, and given that information technologies can address these needs effectively. The assessment literacy required of a teacher today is of a completely different kind --- one that is adapted to the digital environment and tailored for the pedagogical approaches of the 21st century. This article will focus on the skills, abilities, and perceptions required of the teacher in the digital environment with respect to assessment, and will demonstrate the importance of adapting the various technologies to the different assessment purposes. This definition of the term ``Digital assessment literacy'' is based on a doctoral thesis that examined the Relationship between the technological environment and the teaching, learning and assessment processes in online courses (Eyal, 2010).]},

We searched for relevant articles in EBSCO, JSTOR and other databases, and review selected articles with a focus on the complex relationships within and across these levels. Findings reveal a large body of research at the micro-level (teacher), such as on teachers' values, conceptions and knowledge.

It covers six aspects of translation education, i.e., objective setting, learning strategies, resources, technology, learner reflection and assessment, and teacher's role. The results provide insights to the teachers' understanding of student choice, control and responsibility in autonomous translation learning. The findings suggest that the translation students in UK HE are offered the most choice in translation resources and technologies, and the least choice in co-deciding translation syllabi, specialized professional goal and teaching materials; they seem to share consistent control with their teachers over the whole learning process, from goal-setting, to translation task completion, group collaboration, final version and translation quality criteria decision, to self-evaluation and reflection; they are encouraged to take responsibility for their translation products, collaboration in class, for learning to translate, and learning to evaluate and reflect. Nevertheless, the importance of encouraging student self-evaluation, peer-evaluation and self reflection in UK translation education seems to be underestimated, and is recommended to be brought to the forefront of further research.},

Peer assessment is a frequently adopted learning strategy to assist students in rating and offering instant feedback to peers from the perspective of instructors, which has good potential for fostering students' critical thinking. However, the conventional peer-assessment approach mainly focuses on communications between reviewers and reviewees, while peer communications for collaboratively providing comments or suggestions are generally ignored. As a result, the present study proposed a Collaborative Feedback-based Peer-Assessment (CFPA) learning approach; moreover, a learning system was developed for evaluating the effectiveness of the different collaborative peer-assessment approaches by conducting a quasi-experiment in a pre-service teacher training program. Two classes of students participated in the experiment. One class including 48 students was the experimental group learning with the CFPA approach, while the other class with 49 students was the control group learning with the Non-Collaborative Peer Assessment (NCPA) approach. The findings indicated that the pre-service teachers who learned with the proposed approach showed significantly better instructional video development quality and commenting quality as well as higher self-efficacy and critical thinking tendency than those learning with the Non-Collaborative Peer Assessment approach.},

Section III uses Raymond?s influential essay on open source software ?The Cathedral and the Bazaar? as a framework for thinking through these issues, and about alternative power structures in open education.  In Section IV an explicit link is drawn between more equal or democratic power structures and the possibility for developing pedagogies which are critical and reflexive, providing examples which show how certain interpretations of openness can raise opportunities to support critical approaches to pedagogy.},

It plays a role in shaping students' orientations towards future learning, beyond any course, and beyond graduation. It influences the kinds of knowledge and identity that hold legitimate status in disciplines and communities. It shapes power and trust relationships between junior and senior members of organisations, between those with different roles, between educational institutions and society. Through dialogue, this chapter challenges foundational assumptions about assessment in HE by considering meanings, possibilities and examples of `assessment for good' in two disciplinary contexts of medical (Tim) and mathematics (Juuso) education. In doing so, tensions are highlighted between traditions of individualism and authentic, messy forms of learning and unpredictable outcomes. The dialogue in this chapter emphasises that there is no right way to go about assessment for good, and that multiple perspectives need to be taken into account.},

  abstract = {Emergence and development of the blockchain technology, which is able to transform into "a most powerful disruptive innovation", shall definitely concern universities. Moreover, nowadays the blockchain technology meets the challenges that both the system of higher education and the entire society are currently facing. Advantages of the blockchain technology are decentralized open data, absence of forgeries, safe storage of information, and reduction of transaction expenses related to data checkup, control, and verification. This paper provides a critical analysis of application of the blockchain technology considering with its applicability opportunities and restrictions in education; it also aims to identify the consequences of its influence upon the development of education. The article analyzes real cases when this technology was applied, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as an example. The MIT applied it to protect and validate the certificates that it issued. Another example is the Sony Global Education that forms individual data on its trainees' competencies and productivity; a third one relates to the University of Nicosia, which was the first to use smart contracts and accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment. The paper also considers the elements of the blockchain technology at universities (both in Russia and outside it), which participate in massive open online courses. It determines the scope of application of this technology in the Russian educational system. In addition, this article provides a literature review related to application of the blockchain technology; the review includes works by such renowned researchers as D. Tapscott, B. Bleir, A. Watters, A. Grech, A. Camilleri, M. Swan, A. Zaslavsky, etc. The paper analyzes the obtained findings of the survey that its authors have conducted among experts, professors, and specialists involved in accreditation. Thus, the paper provides an analysis of opportunities and restrictions related to application of the blockchain technology in higher education.},

  abstract = {The credibility of unsupervised online exams is an ongoing concern in higher education. Proctoring, in the form of physical or remote supervision, has been the main mechanism for maintaining academic integrity. However, both forms of proctoring are expensive and inconvenient. Several researchers have examined security mechanisms as a substitute for proctoring and obtained mixed results. This article describes a quasi-experimental study, the main goal of which was to examine the effectiveness of nonbiometric security mechanisms. The security mechanisms were selected based on the taxonomy of cheating reduction techniques rooted in the fraud triangle theory. The security mechanisms were considered effective if the scores were equivalent or lower on the unproctored exams. Two one-sided dependent {$<$}em{$>$}t {$<$}/em{$>$}tests were used to test for equivalence of scores on two sets of proctored and unproctored exams in face-to-face ({$<$}em{$>$}N {$<$}/em{$>$}= 704), hybrid ({$<$}em{$>$}N {$<$}/em{$>$}= 91), and online ({$<$}em{$>$}N {$<$}/em{$>$}= 55) introductory statistics community college courses. In the first set, the proctored exam was followed by the unproctored exam; in the second set, the order was reversed. In the first set, the scores on proctored and unproctored exams were equivalent in face-to-face and online groups, but students in the hybrid group had significantly lower scores on the unproctored exam. In the second set, the students' scores were lower on the unproctored exam in all groups. The study's results suggest that the used security mechanisms were effective.},

  abstract = {Technical fields such as computer science and software engineering have placed an emphasis on collaboration and teamwork, and training students entering these fields is a challenge that educators and researchers have attempted to tackle. To develop students' skills for these technical fields, some educators have integrated learning ac- tivities where students collaborate heavily and make contributions to each other's learning, emulating the type of work students will perform in industry. Consequently, the learning tools that instructors use for their courses need to support these collab- orative and contributive activities. GitHub is a social coding tool that has seen rapid adoption in the software devel- opment field because of the open, collaborative workflow it encourages. This thesis explores the use of GitHub as a collaborative platform for computer science and soft- ware engineering education. GitHub provides users with opportunities to contribute to each other's work through its transparency features, supports integrated discus- sions, and provides support for reusing and remixing work---opportunities which may be extended to education. In this thesis, I investigate how GitHub's unique features, such as `pull requests' and commit histories, can be used to support learning and teaching. This work also explores the benefits and challenges that emerge from using GitHub in this context from both the instructor's and the student's perspectives. We found that GitHub afforded instructors with opportunities to encourage student participation by con- tributing to the course materials through the use of `pull requests' and provided instructors with ways to reuse and share their course materials. As well, students iv gained experience with a tool and a workflow they expected to encounter in indus- try, and were provided ways to further engage in their learning by giving feedback to or further developing other students' work. However, we found that instructors and students were challenged by GitHub's lack of educational focus, as well as the implications of using GitHub's open workflow on the public availability of student work. Findings from this work determine the viability of GitHub as a tool for supporting computer science and software engineering education, and contribute to our under- standing of what activities and benefits GitHub provides beyond traditional learning tools. The contributions of this work include a set of recommendations for instruc- tors wishing to use GitHub to augment their courses, utilizing GitHub's features to support educational activities such as student contributions to course materials and providing continuous feedback to students},

The development of the MCIDA also serves as an example for how traditional summatively oriented assessment procedures can be developed into tools that directly support student learning.},

Assessment in higher education is often via written exams. But these provide limited feedback and do not ask students to put knowledge into practice. This does not support the tenets of flipped learning. For two years, the author flipped instruction but retained traditional curricula and assessment. However, on the author's current course, all three aspects were redesigned to better support flipped learning. The aim of this research is to test the effectiveness of this redesign regarding student engagement and satisfaction. Thus, it is asked: How, on this course, can meaningful, continuous assessment be provided as well as effective, personalized feedback, while staying in line with the philosophy of flipped learning? Action research took place from September 2016 to June 2017. Quantitative data from a student survey, and qualitative data from a research diary and student focus group were gathered. What emerged is: a little-and-often assessment approach is effective for learning and engagement; tasks must be authentic and test demonstration of knowledge, not memory; quality, not quantity, is key for student learning; and students desire individualized feedback.},

The Proclamation reserved land west of the Appalachian Mountains for Indians, and required the Crown to purchase Indian land through treaties, negotiated without coercion and in public, before issuing rights to newcomers to use and settle on the land. Marking its 250th anniversary Keeping Promises shows how central the application of the Proclamation is to the many treaties that followed it and the settlement and development of Canada. Promises have been made to Aboriginal peoples in historic treaties from the late eighteenth to the early twentieth centuries in Ontario, the Prairies, and the Mackenzie Valley, and in modern treaties from the 1970s onward, primarily in the North. In this collection, essays by historians, lawyers, treaty negotiators, and Aboriginal leaders explore how -- and how well -- these treaties are executed. Addresses by the governor general of Canada and the federal minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development are also included. In 2003 Aboriginal leaders formed the Land Claims Agreements Coalition to make sure that treaties -- building blocks of Canada -- are fully implemented. Unique in breadth and scope, Keeping Promises is a testament to the research, advocacy, solidarity, and accomplishments of this coalition and those holding the Crown to its commitments"--Back cover},

One institution's response to these factors has been to redefine the core of its Graduate Diploma in Legal Practice as an online, group based, integrated and simulated learning environment. In this new learning environment, the integration of assessment within the 'course work' has potentially had the outcome of creating a sustainable assessment regime that results in learning outcomes that benefits students as they move beyond academia to the legal profession. This paper provides a case study of this teaching methodology and analyses whether sustainable assessment has been achieved. [Publisher abstract];},

We developed this study following the methodology supported by the PRISMA statement and the PICoS strategy, retrieving scientific literature from Web of Science, Scopus, ERIC and PsycINFO. Of the 241 studies that the search yielded, 29 have been included. The results showed that online education was an enabling alternative for the development of higher education, but numerous weaknesses in the transition to online education were identified. The study concludes that online learning is a future direction in higher education. Therefore, institutions should invest more in online education platforms and improve faculty training plans.},

After screening according to the inclusion criteria established by consensus among researchers, a total of 88 articles were obtained (n = 88). The main results point to several variables that should be strengthened to promote the integration of digital technologies in the classroom, among which teacher training stands out as a determining factor, with special emphasis on initial training.

We demonstrate that all five approaches are similarly principled, but reflect principled elements in their own unique ways, and how they are similar to, and different from, conventional approaches to principled test design. Finally, we discuss practical challenges and considerations for selecting a principled approach and end with speculations about the evolution of principled approaches in the future.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 crisis has strongly affected the school system. In Italy, at-distance forms of didactics have been activated, changing the physiognomy of schools in terms of social interaction, practices and the identity of the individuals. In this paper, we address the issue of how teachers are facing the crisis: our focus is on assessment, as a key variable catalyzing personal history; beliefs; the interface between students; teachers and the school system. We study teachers' beliefs as part of their identities and assessment as a fundamental variable of beliefs. A qualitative content analysis of the open-ended answers to an online questionnaire is carried out to understand the main characteristics associated with assessment by teachers and the obstacles to overcome in the context of long distance learning (LDL). The data show that teachers did not identify valid assessment methods for LDL during the lockdown, especially due to the lack of control over the students. A misconception emerges concerning the definition of formative assessment together with a new awareness of the possibilities offered by digital technologies regarding the individualization of didactics. This study helps to understand which teachers' beliefs are related to assessment are and how they are shaped.},

The book lays out the mathematical foundations of EFA; explores the range of methods for extracting the initial factor structure; explains factor rotation; and outlines the methods for determining the number of factors to retain in EFA. The concluding chapter addresses a number of other key issues in EFA, such as determining the appropriate sample size for a given research problem, and the handling of missing data. It also offers brief introductions to exploratory structural equation modeling, and multilevel models for EFA. Example computer code, and the annotated output for all of the examples included in the text are available on an accompanying website.},

Stronger connections between the use of ICT in schools, contextual factors, and theoretical approaches are needed if teachers are to use digital tools effectively in the classroom. This study explores multimodal digital classroom assessments (MDCAs) as a subset of classroom assessments. Combining multimodal perspectives with performance assessment theory, the paper analyzes three examples of MDCAs developed in collaboration with practitioners as part of a formative experiment and discusses their affordances and potential relevance for practice. MDCAs may offer richer repertoires of modalities for students and teachers. However, implementing MDCAs requires continuous attention to validity, literacy demands, and management of the longitudinal nature of certain MDCAs. Therefore, to provide a meaningful picture of student learning, design processes should consider how evidence from MDCAs complements conventional assessment practices. {$\bullet$}This study explores multimodal digital classroom assessments (MDCAs).{$\bullet$}The paper analyzes three examples of MDCA practices designed by teachers.{$\bullet$}MDCAs may offer richer repertoires of modalities available for students and teachers.{$\bullet$}Implementing MDCAs requires attention to validity, literacy demands, and the longitudinal nature of certain MDCAs.},

Various design disciplines use studio teaching as a pedagogy to educate students for professions in art and design. Studio teaching bases a high premium on face-to-face interactions which guide learning through dialogue and feedback on individual work. Many design educators believe it is difficult or even impossible to teach design online because of studio-based interactions. Is design one of those disciplines that cannot be taught online because of the studio culture? This study explores that question by investigating the effectiveness of teaching design subjects that employ a virtual classroom to manage peer-to-peer critiques, instructor feedback, and assignments. Twenty-eight first-year students participated in two online design subjects that required them to interact with fellow students and the design instructor via a Learning Management System. The experienced benefits and challenges of students and instructors are presented, and future research is highlighted.},

Method. Eighteen participants created digital stories and hosted screenings in their own communities to foster dialogue. Data for this article are drawn from individual semistructured interviews with the youth leaders, audio-recordings of audience reflections, and research team member?s field notes collected between 2012 and 2015 across Canada. Data were coded using NVivo. A content analysis approach guided analysis. Results. The process of sharing their digital stories had a positive impact on the youth themselves and their communities. Stories also reached policymakers. They challenged conventional public health messaging by situating HIV in the context of Indigenous holistic conceptions of health. Discussion. The impact(s) of sharing digital stories were felt most strongly by their creators but rippled out to create waves of change for many touched by them. More research is warranted to examine the ways that the products of participatory visual methodologies can be powerful tools in creating social change and reducing health disparities.}

It focuses upon the perceptions of undergraduates about issues of effectiveness, fairness and feedback, particularly in regard to the so-called learner-centred methods. In total, 378 undergraduate students participated in the study at the University of Minho (254) and at the University of Lisbon (124). Data were collected through questionnaires. Findings suggest that the most frequent assessment methods are written tests, oral presentations in group and project work. Participants who are assessed by methods which require their active involvement view assessment as a fairer and more effective process than students who are assessed by more traditional methods such as examinations and written tests. However, the idea of conflict in assessment emerged as a key distinctive feature associated with learner-centred assessment methods such as project work and portfolios. Implications of the findings for developing learner-centred methods in higher education are discussed.},

This study is part of a larger research project entitled "Assessment in higher education: the potential of alternative methods" funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (Government Funding Agency) (PTDC/MHCCED/2703/2014). This paper surveys a large sample (N = 5549) of Portuguese students in five public universities with a Portuguese version of the Students Conceptions of Assessment (SCoA-VI) inventory, previously validated in Brazil. Confirmatory factor analysis recovered the eight SCoA factors reported in the Brazilian context. Differences in mean score for the eight factors were trivial for institutional and student factors. Overall, students agreed that assessment for student improvement was not ignored. Scale inter-correlations revealed interesting inverse relations between improvement and irrelevance functions.},

To structure the presentation of the research contributions, we propose novel technically oriented typologies for plagiarism prevention and detection efforts, the forms of academic plagiarism, and computational plagiarism detection methods. We show that academic plagiarism detection is a highly active research field. Over the period we review, the field has seen major advances regarding the automated detection of strongly obfuscated and thus hard-to-identify forms of academic plagiarism. These improvements mainly originate from better semantic text analysis methods, the investigation of non-textual content features, and the application of machine learning. We identify a research gap in the lack of methodologically thorough performance evaluations of plagiarism detection systems. Concluding from our analysis, we see the integration of heterogeneous analysis methods for textual and non-textual content features using machine learning as the most promising area for future research contributions to improve the detection of academic plagiarism further.},

We offer three resulting opportunities: the introduction of an integrated epistemic and developmental model that explains how teachers' pedagogical reasoning and action (PR\&A) for technology integration are shaped, teaching approximations of core practices for technology integration, and promoting PR\&A and decision-making for simple adaptive Digital Formative Assessment Tools as an overall agenda to enhance policy, practice and research relating to teachers pedagogical reasoning, decision making and action in technology rich contexts.

However, results of research on the value of technological tools and blended courses in various academic disciplines are not consistent and only point to minimal effects on academic achievement. To fill this gap, in this study, participation in optional electronic quizzes and its effects on exam grades in large statistics classes depending on gender and previous statistics- and mathematics-related abilities are investigated. Overall, participation in the electronic quizzes yielded a positive effect on final grades. However, particularly the groups who participated less in the electronic quizzes - i.e. poor performing students and males - benefitted more from quiz participation than high performing and female students. The large variability in effect sizes of feedback on performance suggests that additional moderators such as specific situation- and task-related characteristics and individual affective preconditions such as effort, motivation, and self-esteem should be analyzed in future research.},

We review the arguments for and against their use, across seven common themes: memory recall and knowledge retention; student motivation and learning; authenticity and real-world relevance; validity and reliability; academic misconduct and contract cheating; stress, anxiety and wellbeing; and fairness and equity. For each theme, we evaluate empirical evidence for the perceived pedagogical benefits and pedagogical drawbacks of high-stakes examinations. We find that relatively few of the perceived academic benefits of high-stakes examinations have a strong evidence base. Support for their use is largely rooted in opinion and pragmatism, rather than being justified by scientific evidence or pedagogical merit. By contrast, there is substantial evidence for pedagogical drawbacks of high-stakes summative examinations. We conclude that the current heavy reliance on high-stakes final examinations in many university subjects is poorly justified by the balance of empirical evidence.},

At the second stage (JanuaryFebruary 2021), two focus groups (N = 24) were conducted, which allowed us to refine the previously obtained data. The authors conclude that the attitude of students to the digitalization of education is determined by the experience of distance learning during the pandemic. According to the research, students' expectations are related to the content aspect of using digital technologies in the educational process: developing practical skills and maintaining interest in learning. However, young people are not fully focused on the consumption of educational content for the development of their competencies in the chosen field of study. The availability of educational materials, video recordings of lectures in the virtual educational space does not serve as a compensator for key dysfunctions: a decrease in the share of live communication, narrowing of communication channels, lack of motivation to learn, etc. This educational requirement determined the prospects for the transformation of the professional role of the teacher: from the "translator of knowledge" to the "moderator of the creative space".},

Online training has become an alternative to the face-to-face format of classes, which updates the analysis of key risks and problems of the educational process in the context of the pandemic. The leading research method was a questionnaire survey of students with online learning experience (N = 146 people). The survey was conducted in May 2020. For a deeper interpretation of a number of conclusions, the authors conducted a focus group in September 2020 (N = 12 people), which included students of 2-3 years of study at Russian universities. The authors set a goal to study the degree of adaptation of students to new learning conditions, the specifics of their perception of various aspects of learning in an online environment, problems and risks. The results of the study showed that every fourth student when switching to online mode could not successfully adapt to the new format of training. It is concluded that the key risks of online learning are associated with the lack of direct communication channels, the spread of the practice of imitating students' learning activities in the context of reducing the control function of the teacher. The lack of readiness of students to maintain the necessary level of self-organization led to a decrease in students' requirements for themselves as an active participant in the educational process, while increasing requirements for digital competencies and personal qualities of the teacher. In terms of online learning, students demonstrate the need for additional measures to maintain interest in learning: game context, network interaction in the "student-student" system, charismatic presentation of material.},

There is no shortage of technical guidance for conducting assessment (e.g. Allen, 2006; Bresciani, 2007; Bresciani, Zelna, \& Anderson, 2004; Lui, 2011; Maki, 2010; Suskie, 2009; Walvrood \& Anderson, 2010), and a great deal of energy and resources are expended gathering, analyzing, interpreting, disseminating, and using data generated through this methodological advice. Yet, the advancement of assessment methods has outpaced explorations of assessment's philosophy and discourses of how assessment and campus cultures are changed have been slow to emerge. In essence, the art and science of assessment are divided and, as Snow (1959) cautions, ``when those two senses have grown apart, then no society is going to be able to think with wisdom'' (p. 29). As higher education places greater emphasis on empirical data from standardized learning, research regarding why assessment is conducted, how it is leveraged for change, and the ramifications of assessment's purposes must be elevated to a more meaningful level. To this end a new instrument---The Survey of Assessment Culture {\copyright} --- was developed to explore factors and strategies influencing the cultivation of cultures of assessment. The Survey supports research and dialogue into cultures of assessment and how assessment emerges as an accepted institutional way of existence. This article reviews the methodological approaches used in the study, shares basic descriptive statistics, and concludes by discussing various implications for the study of assessment cultures and for administrative practice in higher education and educational administration preparation programs.},

It draws on recent ESRC?funded research by the authors in contemporary workplace settings in the UK (manufacturing industry and secondary schools) to establish the extent to which Lave and Wenger's theories can adequately illuminate the nature and process of learning at work. The new research presented here, which was located in complex institutional settings, highlights the diverse nature of patterns and forms of participation. Case study evidence is used to identify individual and contextual factors which underpin and illuminate the ways in which employees learn. The paper argues that whilst Lave and Wenger's work continues to provide an important source of theoretical insight and inspiration for research in to learning at work, it has significant limitations. These limitations relate to the application of their perspective to contemporary workplaces in advanced industrial societies and to the institutional environments in which people work. These complex settings play a crucial role in the configuration of opportunities and barriers to learning that employees encounter.},

Since then, technological advances have enabled innovative practices and tools that have revolutionised how learners are assessed. In this updated consensus, we bring together the potential of technology and the ultimate goals of assessment on learner attainment, faculty development, and improved healthcare practices. Methods As a material for the report, we used the scholarly publications on TEA in both HPE and general higher education, feedback from 2020 Ottawa Conference workshops, and scholarly publications on assessment technology practices during the Covid-19 pandemic. Results and conclusion The group identified areas of consensus that remained to be resolved and issues that arose in the evolution of TEA. We adopted a three-stage approach (readiness to adopt technology, application of assessment technology, and evaluation/dissemination). The application stage adopted an assessment 'lifecycle' approach and targeted five key foci: (1) Advancing authenticity of assessment, (2) Engaging learners with assessment, (3) Enhancing design and scheduling, (4) Optimising assessment delivery and recording learner achievement, and (5) Tracking learner progress and faculty activity and thereby supporting longitudinal learning and continuous assessment.},

These aspirations are difficult to realize in open, online environments, which enable multiple, and often conflicting, perspectives. This paper proposes a counter-narrative that surfaces certain operational norms of the internet and foregrounds their exclusionary nature. We offer an illustrative inventory of some social media interactional patterns to examine communication used in open online education communities. This examination leads us to conclude that language online is subject to a dialectical tension that both includes and excludes. We conclude that a different language is needed in open online educational environments; one that embraces exclusionary structures and strategic ambiguity, as well as the aspirations to further democratize education via digital means.}

  abstract = {Purpose: In spring 2020, educators throughout the world abruptly shifted to emergency remote teaching in response to an emerging pandemic. The instructors of a graduate-level synchronous online geometry and measurement course for practicing school teachers redesigned their summative assessments. Their goals were to reduce outside-of-class work and to model the integration of content, pedagogy and technology. This paper aims to describe the development of a digital interactive notebook (dINB) assignment using online presentation software, dynamic geometry tools and mathematical learning trajectories. Broader implications for dINBs as assessments in effective distance learning are presented. Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative analysis in this study consists of a sequence of first-cycle coding of mid-semester surveys and second-cycle thematic categorizations of mid-semester surveys and end-of-course reflections. Descriptive categorization counts along with select quotations from open-ended participant responses provided a window on evolving participant experiences with the dINB across the course. Findings: Modifications to the dINB design based on teacher mid-semester feedback created a flexible assessment tool aligned with the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework. The teachers also constructed their own visions for adapting the dINB for student-centered instructional technology integration in their own virtual classrooms. Originality/value: The development of the dINB enriched the TPACK understandings of the instructors in this study. It also positioned teachers to facilitate innovative synchronous and blended learning in their own school communities. Further analysis of dINB artifacts in future studies will test the hypothesis that practicing teachers' experiences as learners increased their TPACK knowledge.},

The results of multiple regression analysis showed that certain levels of cognitive presence were associated with students' academic performance. In addition, network analysis of discussion forums revealed that student centrality within their learning networks moderated the association between the highest level of cognitive presence and academic performance.

  abstract = {The global higher education landscape is significantly impacted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the majority of the universities now follow an online or hybrid mode of delivery. This presents substantial challenges for universities, particularly to conduct examinations, as traditionally most exams were conducted physically on campus. During the first wave of the pandemic, many universities had no option and were forced to move online in a very short period of time, causing universities also to conduct exams online without transforming pedagogy and the structure/s of closed-book exams. Inevitably, in non-proctored and unregulated examinations, this allowed room for students to collaborate and share material during online exams without being noticed by an invigilator as in the case of physical exams. Online exams, also leave room for students to find information online which made preventing plagiarism a significant challenge. This paper investigates the practices used in both closed-book and open-book exams and identifies the challenges associated with the transition to online exams. It also identifies potential ways forward for future online exams, while minimizing opportunities for students to collaborate, plagiarise and use online material. The findings of this study reveal that online examinations affect teachers and students differently: while teachers have mixed feelings about online exams, students are anxious about their grades and the technical hassle they experience in online exams. While viva has emerged as a popular form of alternative assessment, students still feel the need of returning to physical exams. None of the teachers who participated in this study discussed a psychosocial approach to education and exams in this pandemic. We conclude this study on the note that there is a need for the collaboration of social scientists, psychologists, psychosocial specialists, educationists, and humanities scholars/humanists for better educational policy and pedagogical practices during the pandemic.},

  abstract = {As a consequence of the global health emergency in early 2020, universities had to tackle a sudden shift in their teaching-learning strategies so that the preset competences could be fulfilled. This study presents the learning outcomes of the implemented tasks, student experiences, and feedback, as well as some reflections from the instructors with a holistic perspective of the courses due to the adopted measures and adaptations. Six courses taught at civil engineering degrees of three universities, two from Spain and one from Peru, were analyzed. The teaching and evaluation strategies are described, and some reflections are made by comparing the student's performance with the previous course. Though the shift to online learning had to be made from day to day, with no time for preparation, the experience has proved that online learning can be beneficial in some aspects and has probably come to stay, although some other aspects are difficult to replace with respect to face-to-face learning, especially students' engagement and motivation. The significance of this study relies on a description of the challenges that arose due to the global public health and an assessment of the results of the implemented strategies to account for both teaching and evaluation in modules of civil engineering. After the acquired experience, new questions have arisen, e.g., what type of content is (and what is not) adequate or suitable for online exams? What features have come to stay? Has higher education taken a step forward to tomorrow's education?},

They are considered suitable collaborative learning environments to conduct discussions among groups of learners (Lieblein, as cited in Lamb, 2004; Zhu, 2006; Swan, 2001; Palloff \& Pratt, 2005). However, despite their relevance, web-based forums have been reported to be lacking when measuring the productivity of participants' interaction. Although previous studies have suggested the use of Short Message Service in supporting online collaboration, little research has been conducted to understand whether mobile phones increase interaction in online discussions and how interacting via mobile phones differs from desktop computers. Thus, this exploratory case study examines online collaboration through Moodle forums on desktop computers and the LINE chat application on smartphones. First, this paper compares how these two types of media influence the participation, interaction and collaboration of students. Second, it inquires into the students' collaboration experiences, opinions, and difficulties they encountered during the online discussions. Finally, it explores the impact that these two types of media had on the students' final outcome. Based on a literature review, the results of the content analysis of the posts and the experiences shared by the participants, this study concludes that mobile phones have great potential to enhance interaction in online collaboration.},

This review of distance education as a field of study reveals an early preoccupation with organizational and structural constraints. However, the review also reveals that the theoretical development of the field is progressing from organizational to transactional issues and assumptions. The question is whether distance education has the theoretical foundation to take it into the 21st century and whether distance education theory development will keep pace with innovations in technology and practice.},

  abstract = {Although studied for decades by the research community, artificial intelligence (AI) in education has recently sparked much public debate with the wide-spread popularity of systems such as ChatGPT and DALL-E. Existing literature offers a wealth of research on design, deploying and evaluating AI-driven systems in education. However, the challenges related to the growing influence of AI in the society, calls for revisiting research foundations of AI in education in order to inform decision-making in policy and guide future research. This special issue of Computers \& Education: Artificial Intelligence brings 11 papers that explore the theme of empowering learners for the age of AI. The contributions of these papers can be broadly grouped into seven main themes: intersection between AI and humans that looks at the space of coordination; assessment that explores challenges and opportunities afforded by the use of AI in educational assessment; explainability in AI as a critical need for humans in education to understand and trust AI; design for learning that offers principles for designing AI-driven systems and educational opportunities; conceptual AI and learning exploring the need for the development of new theories of learning and their connections with existing theoretical foundations in education; accurate predictions and their role in future education; and applications of AI in classrooms and educational systems. The findings of these studies highlight pressing research and policies challenges and opportunities that arise with the broad penetration of AI in education. They also emphasize the need for future research that addresses issues of ethics, bias and farness in the use of AI in education; challenges associated with data sources and ownership as the key fuel and enabler of present-day AI generation; AI literacies and competencies of stakeholders who use and are impacted by AI in education; identification of effective learning and teaching practices with the use of AI; and policy development to increase responsiveness of education systems to rapid changes driven by AI.},

The content fetish is the view that any academic area (whether physics, sociology, or history) is composed of a set of facts or a body of information and that the way learning should work is through teaching and testing such facts and information.However, for some current learning theorists, ``know'' is a verb before it is a noun, ``knowledge'' (Barsalou 1999a, 1999b; Bereiter and Scardamalia 1993; Clark 1997; Glenberg 1997; Glenberg and Robertson 1999; Lave and Wenger 1991; Rogoff 1990). Any actual domain of knowledge, academic or not, is first and foremost a set of activities (special ways of acting and interacting so as to produce and use knowledge) and experiences (special ways of seeing, valuing, and being in the world). Physicists do physics. They talk physics. And when they are being physicists, they see and value the world in a different way than do non-physicists. The same applies for good anthropologists, linguists, urban planners, army officers, doctors, artists, literary critics, historians, and so on (diSessa 2000; Lave 1996; Ochs, Gonzales, and Jacoby 1996; Shaffer 2004).Yet if much decontextualized, overt information and skill-and-drill on facts does not work as a theory of learning, neither does ``anything goes,'' ``just turn learners loose in rich environments,'' ``no need for teachers'' (Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark 2006).},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONThe field of psychometrics has been predominant in work on testing and assessment. For the most part, psychometrics has been strongly influenced by traditional psychological assumptions about the mind and learning. Work that takes a sociocultural perspective has played a much smaller role and has heretofore made little contact with psychometrics. This chapter discusses contributions such a sociocultural perspective has to make to issues of assessment and testing, with a focus on an expanded notion of opportunity to learn (OTL). Ensuring that all learners have had equal OTL is both an ethical prerequisite for fair assessment and a solid basis on which to think about educational reforms that will ensure that all children can succeed at school. It is also a point at which mutually informing discussion can occur between people working in psychometrics and those working on sociocultural approaches to learning.This section begins with a consideration of the traditional perspective in psychology, one that views knowledge and learning through the lens of mental representations in individuals' heads (Clancey 1997). Even in this traditional view, many of the types of issues that sociocultural perspectives emphasize also arise, although in a more backgrounded way. I will then turn to a more direct consideration of sociocultural perspectives, starting with the relationship between learners and their learning environments. In subsequent sections, I will spell out this relationship in terms of the connections between learning and learners' experiences in the world; how knowledge is distributed across people and their tools; the central importance of people's participation in shared talk and social practices; and the nature of the special varieties of language used in talk and participation when people learn in content areas in school -- areas like math, science, social studies, and literature.},

  abstract = {Good computer and video games like System Shock 2, Deus Ex, Pikmin, Rise of Nations, Neverwinter Nights, and Xenosaga: Episode 1 are learning machines. They get themselves learned and learned well, so that they get played long and hard by a great many people. This is how they and their designers survive and perpetuate themselves. If a game cannot be learned and even mastered at a certain level, it won't get played by enough people, and the company that makes it will go broke. Good learning in games is a capitalist-driven Darwinian process of selection of the fittest. Of course, game designers could have solved their learning problems by making games shorter and easier, by dumbing them down, so to speak. But most gamers don't want short and easy games. Thus, designers face and largely solve an intriguing educational dilemma, one also faced by schools and workplaces: how to get people, often young people, to learn and master something that is long and challenging--and enjoy it, to boot.},

  abstract = {Online courses today give a broad, diverse population access to higher education. Despite postsecondary institutions embracing this opportunity, scholarly literature reveals persistent concern over low retention rates in online courses. In response to this concern, an explanatory sequential, mixed methods study was conducted in three phases at a public research university to simultaneously explore personal, circumstantial, and course variables associated with student success from a strengths-based perspective. In Phase One, existing data on student enrollments across four years were analyzed. During Phase Two, a subset of Phase One students from a single semester was invited to complete an assessment of noncognitive attributes and personal perceptions, followed in Phase Three by interviews among a stratified sample of successful students from the previous phase to elaborate on factors impacting their success. Quantitative analyses identified seven individual variables with statistical and practical significance for online student success. Interestingly, the combination of factors classified as predictive of success changed with student academic standing. The impact of differential success factors across academic experience may explain mixed results in previous studies. The themes that emerged from the interviews with students were congruent with quantitative findings. A unique perspective was shared when students discussed "teaching themselves," providing additional insight into perceptions of teaching presence not formerly understood. The combination of a more contextual research approach, a strengths-based perspective, and insights from student perceptions yielded implications for educational practice.},

The study results show that demographic variables were strongly accounted for the variances in awareness of psychological counseling and use of the service. Majority of the male students (67.8\%) had not heard about the presence of psychological counseling service while 24.3\% of female students did not know about such a service. More than 60\% of the study participants gave top priority for psychological counseling service in higher education institutions. Students' year of study and place of residence were significantly associated with the students rating of crisis intervention and emergency services, ?[superscript 2] (9)=23.40, p{$<$}0.01. The importance given to psychological counseling services also varied based on the place of origin and academic year of the students. Students believed psychological counseling service contributed to their academic success. Implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {At this age of accountability, it is acknowledged that assessment is a powerful lever that can either boost or undermine students learning. Hitherto, much of the regular institutional and instructional practices show that assessments remain inhibitory or void rather than constructive as these lack the assessment formative aspect. This denotes that assessment is either not well understood or not done in a principled educational framework across all educational levels. This is due to some inherited dysfunction of the past, which calls for the urgency of a moratorium. The current article attempts to enhance the EFL practitioners' educational assessment practice as a form of expanding awareness. It attempts to establish a founded theoretical framework for the main concerns that might have been troubling novice and professional EFL practitioners with regard to understanding the working mechanisms of such a perplexing task that has long been delegated to them. Particular aspects of the current review target the definitions of the concept of assessment, the value, functions and purposes of assessment, levels where assessment occur, assessment research literature synopsis, and classroom assessment research (CAR). CAR presents detailed knowledge about the potency of assessment, research on classroom assessment practices, research on alternative assessment, research on formative assessment, and finally quality control criteria for effective classroom assessment. The article culminate in the pedagogical potency of formative assessment and some of its classroom procedural applications inspired from research into formative assessment and how that might contribute to the enhancement of pedagogic practice.},

Therefore, this article discusses how a gamer\&\#039;s platform, Discord can be used as an interactive online class. A comparison of Discord with other online platforms is spelled out in a tabular form. The principle used to design the online class using Discord is based on Community of Inquiry (CoI). CoI consists of three elements which are teaching presence, social presence, and cognitive presence for a better educational experience. The design discussed in this article are Discord features design for the online class and class activity using Discord in developing the three elements in CoI. Data collection is done using open-ended surveys. They are 58 respondents with engineering and non-engineering students. Most of the students are familiar with Discord and agreed that Discord can be adapted for an online class. Thematic analysis is conducted to analyze the open-ended questions. The themes that can be identified are parallel channels, structure, all-in-one platform, facilitation, and learning environment. Another analysis is message counts in each student group to show how active the students in online class using Discord. In conclusion, Discord is the best platform to make students active and construct knowledge with peers.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

The purpose of this chapter is to describe and illustrate the important role that cognitive models play in the item generation process. A cognitive model for automatic item generation is a representation that highlights the knowledge, skills, competencies, and/or content required to generate new test items. Two types of cognitive models are presented. The first is the logical structures cognitive model. It is used when a specific concept or a set of closely related concepts is operationalized as part of the generative process. This model is often used to implement a main idea, formula, algorithm, and/or logical outcome. The second is the key features cognitive model. It is used when the attributes or features of a task are systematically combined to produce meaningful outcomes across the item feature set. This model is most suitable for measuring students' ability to assemble and apply key features within a domain as well as to solve problems using these key features. An application of each model is presented using a practical example from K--12 science and medicine.},

The analyses revealed that some elements of structure had a significant impact on meaningful discourse. Particularly, guidelines that assisted the facilitation and evaluation of online discussions increased the cognitive quality of student postings promoting a deeper and more meaningful understanding of course content.},

We first present a brief literature review on current science standards, learning sciences research on students' difficulties with scientific inquiry practices, and modern assessment design frameworks. We then describe how we used pilot data from four case studies with hands-on inquiry tasks for middle school students to better understand these difficulties and design various components of the Inq-ITS system to support students' inquiry accordingly. Lastly, we describe how we used key computational techniques from knowledge-engineering and educational data mining to analyze data from students' log files in this environment to (1) automatically score students' inquiry skills, (2) provide teachers with fine-grained, rich, classroom-based formative assessment data on these practices, and (3) react in real time to scaffold students as they engage in inquiry.},

This article addresses the following two questions: (1) What are some of the best practices in assessing language skills online and how do they differ from assessment in face-to-face (F2F) courses? (2) How do learning outcomes differ in online vs. F2F courses? Both questions are answered based on previous research and our own practices and results in second-year German. We found that the most effective online practices are too time-consuming and costly to implement. Poor computer literacy skills and test security can be further issues in online environments. The solution lies in frequent formal and informal assessments. When comparing online with F2F language learning, meta-analyses give online formats a slight advantage over F2F (Means, Toyama, Murphy, Bakia, \& Jones, 2009). In this study no significant differences were found between the F2F and online sections. Noteworthy, however, is that large differences in standard deviations and score ranges between online and F2F classes suggest that online language learning works well for some and not as well for others.},

We find that students admit to higher levels of cheating in online classes and believe other students also cheat more relative to face-to-face classes. This is likely due to the lack of tools to combat online cheating and the lack of policy from universities. We know from previous studies that business colleges have a comparatively high level of cheating and the amount of cheating at universities has been rising. These trends threaten to create an unfair system where cheaters are rewarded with higher grades than non-cheaters, thereby encouraging otherwise honest students to cheat. This may result in declining and erratic knowledge among university graduates, diminishing the value of a university education.},

BNs allow modeling a broad range of phenomena by reasoning about collected evidence and by updating beliefs in light of new data.

In this chapter, we discuss how BNs can be used to formalize substantively grounded reasoning processes, we describe the statistical formalism of BNs through some core equations, we illustrate the flexibility of BNs by providing various extensions in simple graphical representations, and we provide examples for modeling cognition across educational, psychological, and linguistic contexts.},

This paper analyzes the use of AI for student assessment based on a systematic review. For this purpose, a search was carried out in two databases: Scopus and Web of Science. A total of 454 papers were found and, after analyzing them according to the PRISMA Statement, a total of 22 papers were selected. It is clear from the studies analyzed that, in most of them, the pedagogy underlying the educational action is not reflected. Similarly, formative evaluation seems to be the main use of AI. Another of the main functionalities of AI in assessment is for the automatic grading of students. Several studies analyze the differences between the use of AI and its non-use. We discuss the results and conclude the need for teacher training and further research to understand the possibilities of AI in educational assessment, mainly in other educational levels than higher education. Moreover, it is necessary to increase the wealth of research which focuses on educational aspects more than technical development around AI.},

This research examines the effects of an online formative assessment tool (OFAT) about science motivation and achievement in second-year students' university education during four consecutive academic years, 2014 to 2018. A research on the basis of a randomized experimental design was conducted that assigned groups used an OFAT along with various assessments that students participated. A total of 311 students enrolled in the subject take part in the research, respectively 94, 89, 59 and 71 students. Particularly, the OFAT is offering feedback from students, feedback from lecturers and adaptive assignments. Here, data contained student motivation survey data, standardized achievement pre- and post-test data and students' log records. The results of multiple tier analyses exposed positive effects about students' motivation and achievement. Based on usage measurements, students' intensity offers the positive effects about students' motivation and achievement. Furthermore, along with overall students' improved performance, the effects of high-performing students' achievement were higher. Therefore, the results acquired meaningfully contribute to recover main drawbacks and difficulties of traditional science learning programs.},

In so doing it utilizes a theoretical framework which conceptualizes writing as contextualized social practice. The paper illustrates the complexity of the rhetorical demands being made on students in these new environments of teaching and learning and, in focusing on writing, complements present approaches to online learning which have, to date, tended towards collaborative and constructivist perspectives. The article highlights the relationship between pedagogy, technology and assessment. It concludes with a discussion of the design of an online writing resource to support student writers on this particular masters programme.},

  abstract = {In low-stakes assessments, some students may not reach the end of the test and leave some items unanswered due to various reasons (e.g., lack of test-taking motivation, poor time management, and test speededness). Not-reached items are often treated as incorrect or not-administered in the scoring process. However, when the proportion of not-reached items is high, these traditional approaches may yield biased scores and thereby threatening the validity of test results. In this study, we propose a polytomous scoring approach for handling not-reached items and compare its performance with those of the traditional scoring approaches. Real data from a low-stakes math assessment administered to second and third graders were used. The assessment consisted of 40 short-answer items focusing on addition and subtraction. The students were instructed to answer as many items as possible within 5 minutes. Using the traditional scoring approaches, students' responses for not-reached items were treated as either not-administered or incorrect in the scoring process. With the proposed scoring approach, students' nonmissing responses were scored polytomously based on how accurately and rapidly they responded to the items to reduce the impact of not-reached items on ability estimation. The traditional and polytomous scoring approaches were compared based on several evaluation criteria, such as model fit indices, test information function, and bias. The results indicated that the polytomous scoring approaches outperformed the traditional approaches. The complete case simulation corroborated our empirical findings that the scoring approach in which nonmissing items were scored polytomously and not-reached items were considered not-administered performed the best. Implications of the polytomous scoring approach for low-stakes assessments were discussed.},

  abstract = {The study process in higher education in Slovenia and worldwide was strongly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, which began in the second semester of the 2019/2020 academic year. There was a sudden shift from face-to-face teaching and learning to virtual teaching and learning; this shift was facilitated by various digital platforms such as Moodle, Zoom and MS Teams and exam applications such as Exam.net. The process of student integration was affected, including formal and informal student interactions with peers, formal and informal teacher-student interactions and students' psychological needs of relatedness, competence and autonomy. In a sample of 110 students of the first year of different study programmes at the University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Education, we investigated how specific study methods and tasks contributed to the students' competence development and how demanding they were for the students during the Covid-19 pandemic. We also analysed the students' perceptions of the online exam process. The results showed a positive contribution of the chosen adapted teaching and learning methods and tasks to the students' competence development and that the students successfully mastered the new skills related to online exams. Furthermore, various study difficulties and examination challenges were mentioned and analysed. Although online teaching and learning is successful, it cannot replace the face-to-face experience, especially in pedagogical faculties where university teachers are important role models for future teachers.},

This may in part be due to the relatively subjective nature of what constitutes a quality response to an assessment task. This paper reports on an experiment that documented the process of decision-making by multiple markers at a university who assessed the same written student assessment responses. The paper analyses the professional conversations between those markers around their conceptions of quality in the student assessment responses. It was found that the markers appeared to share common understandings of quality in the context of the marking criteria and standards across the achievement levels awarded. However, despite these apparently shared notions of quality, in some cases different levels of achievement were awarded to the same student assessment responses. This suggests that that there is a clear need for explicitly stated standard descriptors for each level of achievement and that this must be ...},

Conducting analyses of learning with this perspective involves defining activity systems as the unit of analysis, which includes one or more persons interacting with each other and with material and informational resources that are present in the setting. The main emphasis of the situative perspective is on how learning by individuals and groups is accomplished through interaction between elements of an activity system. Of course there are changes in the participating individuals' mental structures, including schemata, but these are not the primary focus of our analyses. In this view, learning by an individual in a community is conceptualized as a trajectory of that person's participation in the community -- a path with a past and present, shaping possibilities for future participation. Learning by a group or community is also conceptualized as a trajectory -- a path that corresponds to change in the community's practices.A SITUATIVE PERSPECTIVE ON LEARNINGIndividuals Learning in a CommunityLave and Wenger (1991) outlined a situative framework on learning by considering the trajectories of individuals' participation as they become members of a community of practice. As individuals initially join a new activity, their involvement is limited to peripheral participation.},

This challenge is amplified for the students majoring in Information Technology (IT), and cybersecurity in particular, due to the constantly changing technology landscape, intensively competitive markets, and increasingly high expectations from employers on their recruits. While the job demand is high in these fields, it is still difficult for recent college graduates to enter the field. This study shows the initial results of a tool called e-RAP which allows the students to submit their current resumes, obtain automatic feedback and a rating report, and consequently take actions to strengthen their portfolio. The authors employ machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to create a resume analysis and reporting tool. The methodology section provides an overview of the e-RAP analysis process, followed by elaborations on data curation, data collection, and analysis techniques. Several visual examples of the reports generated by e-RAP illustrate the value of the tool in helping enhance students' resumes and eventually the skills areas they need to work on or highlight. A sample of more than 60 resumes were processed through e-RAP and the results were evaluated for potential resume improvements. The future direction includes systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of e-RAP and its impact on our student's ability to get high-quality positions. Diving deeper into the various types of cybersecurity positions is also planned.},

Following the summative assessment, students were asked to complete a feedback form to explain what type of technology assessment they felt was most helpful in providing them with feedback on their knowledge and which was most interesting to use. Instructors also provided feedback on ease of use and collected students' scores on formative and summative assessments. The results of this study suggest that technology-based formative feedback can be effective in helping students prepare for summative exams and that students mostly preferred competitive and fun tools that provide immediate feedback.},

Particularly conducting assessments remotely during COVID-19 has posed extraordinary challenges for higher education institutions owing to lack of preparation superimposed with the inherent problems of remote assessment. In the current study, the challenges of remote assessment during COVID-19 incident in higher education institutions were investigated taking Middle East College as a case study. For the study, questionnaires were prepared and data from 50 faculties were collected and analyzed. The study focused on the challenges of remote assessment in general and academic dishonesty in particular. The main challenges identified in remote assessment were academic dishonesty, infrastructure, coverage of learning outcomes, and commitment of students to submit assessments. To minimize academic dishonesty, preparing different questions to each student was found to be the best approach. Online presentation was also found to be good option to control academic integrity violations. Combining various assessment methods, for instance report submission with online presentation, helps to minimize academic dishonesty since the examiner would have a chance to confirm whether the submitted work is the work of the student.},

Teachers and scholars have recently begun to re-examine these questions central to our current grading system. As a result, many have started to re-assess how grades are assigned in their classes. In this case study, I examine the effectiveness of ungrading, an approach centered around students assigning their own grades through reflecting on the learning process. After contextualizing and describing the approach developed for this fully online, asynchronous history class, I share quantitative and qualitative data regarding student perceptions, motivation, and information usage to argue that systems such as ungrading have potential for contributing to the construction of highly effective and meaningful learning environments.},

Remote proctored exams have become an important tool to ensure integrity and academic honesty in distance education. This mixed methods study aimed at understanding to what extent remote proctored exams impacted the learning process of online graduate students and their academic integrity (ethics), besides the technological factor involved. Results revealed a significant impact of remote proctored exams as regards personal academic honesty because they minimized the possibility of performing acts of dishonesty. Students attributed this to a sense of obligation and the feeling of being watched, rather than internal motivation or a personal reflective process. Lack of privacy and anxiety emerged as aspects of concern for students.},

The members of the anonymous groups used the personal messaging function of WhatsApp for assessment, whereas the nonanonymous groups used the group chat function of the application. WhatsApp was confirmed to be a valid tool for peer assessment, and it was shown that the required anonymity of the method was appropriate for the task. The students' perceived attitudes toward the procedure were found to be rather high, with no significant difference identified between the sophomores and junior groups related to the procedure.},

  abstract = {Purpose               This study aims to assess the adequacy of unified theory of acceptance and use of technology-3 (UTAUT-3) model in understanding academician's adoption to e-Learning, with intent of getting more academicians to accept e-Learning in the Sri Lankan higher education context. Limited validity of the model in an educational context led to this study. The emergence of internet-based technology has changed the way people live, work and study. Technological platforms such as e-Learning have advanced educational systems by enhancing learner experience while benefiting teachers and educators in many ways.                                         Design/methodology/approach               The study used a deductive approach and quantitative methodology, in which a theoretical model was tested using hypotheses to assess causality between study variables. The simple random sampling was used to collect data using a self-administered questionnaire that was sent via Google Forms to targeted respondents. The final sample consisted of 441 academicians who responded to factors of e-Learning adoption on a seven-point Likert scale. Structured equation modelling was used for data analysis.                                         Findings               It was revealed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, habit and hedonic motivation were significant influences of academician's adoption to e-Learning. However, social influence and personal innovativeness in IT were not significant predictors of e-Learning.                                         Research limitations/implications               Due to the scope of the study, the factors that determine e-Learning adoption were limited to UTAUT-3 variables. Additionally, the concept was tested from only an academician's perspective using quantitative methodology.                                         Practical implications               The findings are useful to higher education institute (HEI) administration, instructors and teaching assistants, policymakers to design and implement their online strategy as well as to make appropriate decisions in getting e-Learning accepted among a higher number of local HEI academicians. It is recommended for the decision-makers in the HEIs to consider the effect of the above findings in setting plans for higher e-Learning adoption. For instance, staff training catering to specific departmental needs, continuous awareness building, periodic reviewal of e-Learning system, e-Learning champions, introduction of policies and guidelines to encourage trial usage would be useful in this aspect.                                         Social implications               Successful use of e-Learning would help HEIs to overcome certain issues that exist in a traditional classroom. e-Learning facilitates education delivery beyond time and space while supporting enhanced performance monitoring and skill development which ultimately improve quality of output and institutional performance.                                         Originality/value               The study examined the adequacy of UTAUT-3 in understanding the adoptability to e-Learning. Second, it recognised a set of factors that affect the academic staff acceptance of e-Learning in higher education environments. A useful framework is provided to the HEI's administration to successfully implement e-Learning systems. This study contributes to the growing body of information system literature by examining the validity of UTAUT-3 framework in the use and acceptance of educational technology in a developing country.},

This study developed a problem-based online learning environment based on constructivist learning design model proposed by Jonassen (1999) and evaluated its effectiveness. It was conducted in the spring 2014 semester with an intention to access to total population that is 1,417 students receiving distance education for Turkish II course at six university vocational schools. The online lesson was implemented in one week, and data were gathered through students' performance tasks and self-evaluation form. The research indicated that the problem-based online learning environment has a positive influence on learning. Moreover, it was revealed that dynamic nature of online environment affected learner's participation in the designed activities and collaboration among students could not be fostered.

Unlike the term ``bullshit,'' they argue, commonly used anthropomorphic terms such as ``hallucination'' and ``confabulation'' mispresent LLMs and sow confusion that could be socially harmful. This paper criticizes their essay in two steps. First, its reliance on Harry Frankfurt's classic characterization of bullshit as indifference to truth, though understandable and compelling in one sense, risks misrepresenting LLMs. Second, the argument is too quick to jettison anthropomorphic terms like hallucination and confabulation, which might prove useful metaphors for understanding generative AI. Exploring language to articulate good ways of understanding LLMs is indeed a socially important task, one benefitting from critical open-mindedness, some historical awareness, and a nuanced approach to how various words used to describe AI can operate. This paper attempts to contribute to this task by questioning the wisdom of categorically calling bullshit on ChatGPT.},

When engagement and contribution of all team members cannot be assured, team-based assessment can become an unfair and inaccurate measure of student competency. This case study explores the design and capacity of an online self and intra-team peer-assessment of teamwork strategy to measure student engagement and enable peers to hold each other accountable during team-based assessments. Analysis of student interactions across 39 subjects that implemented the strategy in 2020, revealed that an average of 94.4\% of students completed the self and intra-team peer-assessment task when designed as part of a summative team-based assessment. The analysis also revealed that an average of 10.3\% of students were held accountable by their peers, receiving feedback indicating their teamwork skills and behaviours were below the required minimum standard. Furthermore, the strategy was successfully implemented in cohorts ranging from seven to over 700 students, demonstrating scalability. Thus, this online self and intra-team peer-assessment strategy provided teaching teams with evidence of student engagement in a team-based assessment while also enabling students to hold each other accountable for contributing to the team task. Lastly, as the online strategy pairs with any discipline-specific team-based assessment, it provided the faculty with a method that could be used consistently across its schools to support management and engagement in team-based assessments.},

Institutions of learning were caught unprepared and this jeopardised the face-to-face method of curriculum delivery and assessment. Teaching institutions have shifted to an asynchronous mode whilst attempting to preserve the principles of integrity, equity, inclusiveness, fairness, ethics, and safety. A framework of assessment that enables educators to utilise appropriate methods in measuring a student's progress is crucial for the success of teaching and learning, especially in health education that demands high standards and comprises consistent scientific content. Within such a framework, this paper aims to present a narrative review of the currently utilised methods of assessment in health education and recommend selected modalities that could be administered in an asynchronous mode during the COVID-19 pandemic. Assessment methods such as open-ended short answer questions, problem-based questions, oral exams, and recorded objective structured clinical exams (OSCE) would be appropriate for use in an asynchronous environment to assess the knowledge and competence of health professional students during COVID-19. Fairness and integrity can be ensured by using technological tools such as video and audio recording surveillance.},

  abstract = {Recent technology trends evolved the student assessment from traditional ones ('pen-and-paper' and 'face-to-face') to modern e-Assessment system. These modern approaches allow the teachers to conduct and evaluate an exam with huge number of students in a short period of time. Even more important, both the teacher and the students achieve the evaluation results immediately after the assessment has finished. Although the e-Assessment system speeds up the evaluation, teachers face a huge challenge to prepare, organize and generate a huge set of questions. The questions must cover all learning objectives and their number should be as large as possible to prevent cheating by guessing or memorization of correct answers from previous exams. This paper presents several technologies that can efficiently realize strategies to develop a huge question database with minimal teacher efforts. It also describes the methodologies and strategies based on a specific technology. The technologies are categorized in two classes of e-Assessment systems that are used at the authors' faculty: the traditional e-Assessment system with usual multiple-choice answers and the newest e-Assessment system with interactive images. The question generation is based on defining the questions and answers as XML files (for more advanced users) and MS Word-based files (for users with basic IT background). The question database can be used both for efficient and effective e-Assessment and e-Learning. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

However, little is known regarding how an online supported CBE program can be planned, designed, and implemented, to ensure learners complete activities and thus develop competency. This study advances theoretical perspectives of CBE as steps taken towards the development of an online CBE Framework suitable for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in Kenya. The study found that: Planning (Technology Infrastructure, organization and program design and development); Design (competency standards, instructional design, content development, LMS installation and customization); Implementation (learning activities, Moodle competency framework, assessments, and discussion forums); Improvement (Moodle Analytics) and Achieving (attainment of competency) were the most influential factors in determining the successful implementation of an Online CBE program in HEIs.},

Although most would embrace the goal of enhancing OTL, there are fundamental disagreements about how best to accomplish this and different understandings of the meaning of ``opportunity to learn.'' Historically, conceptions of OTL have been closely tied to the practice of testing. OTL has been conceptualized as opportunity to learn what is tested, and test-based accountability has been widely implemented as a means of enhancing OTL. In the United States, policy makers have embraced test-based accountability as a means of somehow forcing schools to bring ``all children'' to a ``proficient'' level of achievement. By law, tests must be ``aligned'' to rigorous ``academic achievement standards.'' Thus, standardized tests are relied upon to provide both the definition of successful learning and the means to assure that OTL is extended to all learners. Against this vision, many have criticized the conception of learning underlying large-scale testing programs and have argued that test-based accountability has, in fact, undermined many students' opportunities to learn.It is rare to find any productive dialogue between the critics and the proponents of test-based accountability systems. By and large, testing advocates embrace a straightforward account of educational improvement. It is taken as a given that schools are doing a poor job -- the goal of schooling is to impart skills to students, and it is common knowledge that many students graduate without having acquired the skills they need.},

Pioneered in North America, they were developed for contexts with broader access to technology and wider access to the Internet. As globally networked learning environments (GNLEs), MOOCs foster collaborative communities and learning in ways not conceived as feasible until recently. The affordances of MOOCs, such as the ability to access learning beyond one's immediacy, exemplify their benefits for open and distance learning, especially in developing countries that continue to consume rather than produce online courses. However, the globality of MOOCs and their delivery mode pose a challenge of contextualising learning content to the local needs of educational institutions or individual students that choose to use the courses. This theoretical paper used a desk-research approach by revising literature to investigate and propose ways of contextualising MOOCs to the African higher education setting. It applied the principles of reuse and repurposing learning content, while suggesting the use of mobile learning as a technological delivery solution that is relevant to the local context. The paper also suggests a framework for inter-institutional collaboration for higher education institutions to guide future efforts in the creation and sharing of credit-bearing MOOCs.},

  abstract = {Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) is an alternative method to the historically more commonly used covariance-based SEM (CB-SEM) when analyzing the data using structural equation modeling (SEM). The article starts by introducing PLS-SEM to second language and education research, followed by a discussion of situations in which PLS-SEM should be the method of choice for structural equation modeling. It is argued that PLS-SEM is appropriate when complex models are analyzed, when prediction is the focus of the research -- particularly out-of-sample prediction to support external validity, when data do not meet normal distribution assumptions, when formative constructs are included, and when higher-order constructs facilitate better understanding of theoretical models. The most up-to-date guidelines for applying PLS-SEM are provided, and step-by-step guidance is offered on how to apply the method using an R statistical package (i.e., SEMinR) that is available. An example is provided that shows how the results of PLS-SEM are interpreted and reported. We also make the data publicly available for readers to start learning PLS-SEM by replicating our findings. The paper concludes with important considerations for the utilization of SEM, especially PLS-SEM, in future L2 research.},

Preliminary considerations are summarized first, including reasons for choosing PLS-SEM, recommended sample size in selected contexts, distributional assumptions, use of secondary data, statistical power and the need for goodness-of-fit testing. Next, the metrics as well as the rules of thumb that should be applied to assess the PLS-SEM results are covered. Besides presenting established PLS-SEM evaluation criteria, the overview includes the following new guidelines: PLSpredict (i.e., a novel approach for assessing a model's out-of-sample prediction), metrics for model comparisons, and several complementary methods for checking the results' robustness. Design/methodology/approach This paper provides an overview of previously and recently proposed metrics as well as rules of thumb for evaluating the research results based on the application of PLS-SEM. Findings Most of the previously applied metrics for evaluating PLS-SEM results are still relevant. Nevertheless, scholars need to be knowledgeable about recently proposed metrics (e.g. model comparison criteria) and methods (e.g. endogeneity assessment, latent class analysis and PLSpredict), and when and how to apply them to extend their analyses. Research limitations/implications Methodological developments associated with PLS-SEM are rapidly emerging. The metrics reported in this paper are useful for current applications, but must always be up to date with the latest developments in the PLS-SEM method. Originality/value In light of more recent research and methodological developments in the PLS-SEM domain, guidelines for the method's use need to be continuously extended and updated. This paper is the most current and comprehensive summary of the PLS-SEM method and the metrics applied to assess its solutions.},

Participants included nine PSTs studying for their master's degree in a teacher education college in Israel. The PSTs were presented with their own responses and peer's responses about an angle bisector activity, and semi-structured interviews were conducted following the completion of course meetings. Qualitative methods were used to analyse the data. The findings show that the PSTs' experiences of engagement with EETs were reflected in their noticing skills: attending, interpreting and responding. The findings also show that PSTs paid special attention to the variance between submitted examples and noticed the differences between answers. Their experiences also affected their knowledge of content and teaching, namely the proper sequence of instruction and the choice of examples for use in the classroom to facilitate deeper understanding of concepts. Finally, the findings indicate that using EETs on an online formative assessment platform enhanced the noticing skills of PSTs.},

Complex and intricate digital technologies and mobile computing such as simulation, computational design and immersive technologies, have been exploited for different purposes such as reducing cost and time, improving design and enhancing overall project efficiency. Immersive technologies and augmented reality (AR), in particular, have proven to be extremely beneficial in this field. However, the application and usage of these technologies and devices in higher education teaching and learning environments are yet to be fully explored and still scarce. More importantly, there is still a significant gap in developing pedagogies and teaching methods that embrace the usage of such technologies in the AC curricula. This study, therefore, aims to critically analyse the current state-of-the-art and present the developed and improved AR approaches in teaching and learning methods of AC, addressing the identified gap in the extant literature, while developing transformational frameworks to link the gaps to their future research agenda. The conducted analysis incorporates the critical role of the AR implications on the AC students' skillsets, pedagogical philosophies in AC curricula, techno-educational aspects and content domains in the design and implementation of AR environments for AC learning. The outcomes of this comprehensive study prepare trainers, instructors, and the future generation of AC workers for the rapid advancements in this industry.},

Our findings indicate that despite initial uncertainty, students found the environment to be one that promoted learning for the sake of learning, cultivated mental wellness, and compelled them to pursue meaningful questions about their own educational goals and experience. While this development was not without feelings of conflict and struggle throughout the course, by the end of it, students reported a renewed focus on the value of learning.

"Vision 2030" includes support for universities' academic and administrative operations through the collection, rigorous analysis, and reporting of a wide range of data. Prefaced with an overview of the Saudi economic, policy, and educational landscape, the paper's main contribution is a case study of Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University (IAU), chosen because of its recent attempt to institutionalize academic assessment protocols, procedures and culture. It institutionalized a directorate focused on academic assessment, launched a Decision Support Unit dashboard, and developed key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess students' academic performance, course performance and employability. The IAU has since become a regional leader in higher education assessment. Emulating their approach affords other Saudi higher education institutions the opportunity to increase Saudi graduates' ability to directly contribute to the country's economy, ultimately promoting economic growth, diversification, and development as envisioned in "Vision 2030."

This paper analyzed the adoption of using mobile learning (m-learning) in higher education. Mobile Learning as a model of e-learning refers to the acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitudes by utilizing mobile technologies. With the increasing coverage of mobile networks, learning services can play the increasing and effective role in education at any time and place. Continuous access via mobile devices creates special facilities like sending and saving the learning content to learners etc, it is accompanied with continuous education. This paper, with a study of ``what is the impact of the mobile phone usage in education?'' provides approaches and theories of mobile learning in training. The paper aimed to evaluate the essential factors for the adoption and application of education information system that has been created by students. The survey was based on the history of technology adoption and covered students. Furthermore, a case study from students of K. N. Toosi University in Iran was presented to indicate the performance of this method in practice. The statistical society included 300 members from Information Technology students of Iran's K. N. Toosi University of Technology. The factors related to adoption of mobile learning in higher education was classified into seven main categories as: ease of use, trust, characters and personal qualities, context, perceived usefulness of using, behavioral intention, and culture of using a research model. From the results, mobile learning could be one of the promising educational technologies for development in educational environments and culture of using. The context of applications has a significant positive effect on the ease of use factor and usefulness and the ease of use has a positive effect on the usefulness factor. The trust factor has a positive and significant effect on the behavioral intention. The personal features and characters factor have a significant positive effect on the culture of using and the culture of using the application has a significant positive effect on the behavioral intention.},

It investigated the extent to which reported approaches and perceptions and observed online interactions are related to each other and how they contribute to variation in academic performance in a blended course design. Correlation analyses showed significant pairwise associations between approaches and frequency of the online interaction. A cluster analysis identified two groupings of students with different reported learning orientations. Based on the reported learning orientations, one-way ANOVAs showed that students with understanding orientation reported deep approaches to and positive perceptions of learning. The students with understanding orientation also interacted more frequently with the online learning tasks and had higher marks than those with reproducing orientation, who reported surface approaches and negative perceptions. Regression analyses found that adding the observational measures increased 36\% of the variance in the academic performance in comparison with using self-reported measures alone (6\%). The findings suggest using the combined methods to explain students' academic performance in blended course designs not only triangulates the results but also strengthens the acuity of the analysis.

The questionnaire data identified two clusters of students reporting deep and surface study approaches. Students who reported a deep study approach performed better than those who reported a surface study approach on both low-stake and high-stake assessments. The clickstream data detected two clusters of students using either preparation-oriented or assessment-oriented approaches. Students who adopted preparation-oriented approach achieved higher on both low-stake and high-stake assessments. Students' study time measured by both questionnaire data and clickstream data consistently contributed to both low-stake and high-stake assessments. However, the contributions of study approach to academic performance were not consistent across the two types of data, as self-reported study approach was only a significant predictor of high-stake but not low-stake assessment, suggesting that study approach measured by questionnaire data might not be sufficiently sensitive to detect variations in study approaches in flipped classrooms. Pedagogically, the results suggest that raising students' awareness of the importance of pre-lecture learning and aligning assessments and learning activities may foster quality flipped classroom learning. Methodologically, the study demonstrates the advantages of combining questionnaire and clickstream data to understand students' experiences of learning in flipped classrooms.},

In particular, based on surveying and the subsequent development of an example web information system called PlatformWeb, the full integration of an educational institution's administration with its teaching delivery system is recommended.}

The instrument for data collection was the basic analytical chemistry concept test. The results from the test showed that the participants were weak in answering conversion factor, computational, and stoichiometric problems. They also had challenges with fundamental conceptual problems such as understanding and applying principles about limiting reactants, percentage yield, and chemical reactions. These observed weaknesses were noted to be incorporated into building an e-content that would ensure that students have adequate electronic or online practice to overcome their challenges in learning basic analytical chemical concepts.},

Alfred goes on: "Meal change will happen only when settlers are forced into a reckoning of who they are, what they have done, and what they have inherited" (184). Despite years of work by Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the reckoning Alfred speaks of seems a long way off. The majority of Canadians remain ignorant of the history of their country, and removed from colonialism's current manifestations and long-term implications. Some scholars consider the failure to engage in decolonization an act of denial-a choice on the part of beneficiaries who are unwilling to go through the uncomfortable process of decolonization. Others acknowledge the role of widespread ignorance, noting that few Canadians are educated about the history of colonization. Despite theorizing both ignorance and denial, scholars have not explored the connection between the two; as a result, ignorance and denial are often conflated in discussions of Canadian settler culture. In an attempt to better understand the relationship between settler ignorance and denial, this paper will explore the ways that knowledge conditioned by colonial frameworks can prevent settler Canadians from engaging in acts of decolonization. Twill analyze two Ontario Ministry of Education-approved secondary-school history books in relation to a study conducted at Queen's University in 2010 to argue that the Ontario education system strengthens settler ignorance and privileges colonial ideals. I will then analyze Thomas King's short story "Borders" (1993) from an assimilationist perspective in order to highlight how settler ignorance can lead to a denial of colonialism and a perpetuation of colonial ideals, even in the face of decolonizing narratives.},

  abstract = {Previous research, mainly from North America and Asia, has highlighted how many academics in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are concerned about the academic integrity of online distance learning (ODL) compared with face-to-face-teaching and its impact on their work and the student learning experience. Far less is known about this topic for HEIs in the UK, which historically has been slow to adopt technology-enhanced learning overall. The aim of the current study was to determine the attitudes to and experiences of ODL amongst academics in a UK HEI from their own perspective, their students, and that of external stakeholders. The study was based in a long-established HEI in the north of England, UK. Data were collected using an anonymous, self-completion electronic questionnaire which was distributed to academics across the institution. The survey was completed by 531 academics from four of the different faculties. Most of the responders were confident using standard learning management systems for their online teaching, but few were using tools such as social media and web conferencing to engage with students. At least a third of responders expressed positive attitudes to ODL, both from their own and their students' perspectives, and they believed ODL was necessary to maintain student numbers in the future. Those not already doing so also expressed an interest in starting to teach on an ODL. However, not all academics supported ODL, and additional concerns extended to the perceptions of employers, professional organisations, and other countries towards this type of education. The attitudes and experiences of academics in a UK HEI towards ODL varied across a range of teaching-related topics. The results confirm that some academics are confident using online technology for teaching purposes and that they identify with benefits for their students' learning experience. A large proportion wanted to increase their involvement with ODL, and some believed that their faculty needed to increase the ODL provision to maintain the current number of registered students. There was a suggestion that an important number of employers, professional organisations, and even some countries did not believe qualifications awarded through ODL were at least equivalent to those from face-to-face teaching. Consequently, if the HEI is seeking to increase its ODL provision, then there could be benefits from showcasing examples of good practice to academics from within and outside of the HEI. This needs to coincide with demonstrating the effectiveness of ODL, as compared with face-to-face provision from the student, academic, and faculty perspective. Furthermore, this needs to be communicated to students' prospective future employers.},

By leveraging of activities that were already in place prior to the pivot to online learning, namely, an electronic laboratory notebook through bluedoorlabs and assessments that emphasized student reasoning, these challenges were addressed. Herein our approach to providing a meaningful laboratory experience and lower-stakes assessments is described. On the basis of our experiences in Spring 2020, we look forward to the fall semester, where the university is committed to reopening in a dedensified fashion with students in classrooms and laboratories.},

Its power is frequently mentioned in articles about learning and teaching, but surprisingly few recent studies have systematically investigated its meaning. This article provides a conceptual analysis of feedback and reviews the evidence related to its impact on learning and achievement. This evidence shows that although feedback is among the major influences, the type of feedback and the way it is given can be differentially effective. A model of feedback is then proposed that identifies the particular properties and circumstances that make it effective, and some typically thorny issues are discussed, including the timing of feedback and the effects of positive and negative feedback. Finally, this analysis is used to suggest ways in which feedback can be used to enhance its effectiveness in classrooms.},

A five module training package was developed following a literature review and consultation with stakeholders. The simulation-based package immersed students in a real-life scenario and was delivered to final year pharmacy students over a six-week period in 2016. Data on knowledge, skills and confidence was collected via a survey in the week preceding engagement with the online training package and 1 week post completion of the training. The mean score was compared across four student categories: three categories incorporated students who had not completed a hospital pharmacy placement and one category comprised students who had completed a hospital placement. Qualitative feedback was collected via an online survey at the conclusion of the training program. Of the 79 participants, 44 (55.7\%) completed both the pre and post- test surveys that showed the change in score was statistically significant. There was a significant positive change in mean test scores across all four student categories for the domains of skills, knowledge and confidence. Assessment of students' confidence according to 16 ranking statements also improved markedly post-training. Thirty-one students provided qualitative feedback that was generally positive. The positive outcomes reinforce the rationale to include online simulation-based methodologies as part of pharmacy education programs. The model provides a reproducible framework for online simulated learning activities that could be applied within various professions and educational environments.},

Multiple recommendations and results for feedback emerged which fall into the categories described by Susan Brookhart. This review found research for each of Brookhart's categories, with results indicating differences between the perceptions of adherence to sound feedback practices versus the reality of implementation, the potential for innovative tool use, and a disagreement about the effectiveness of peers for providing effective feedback. Indicators for quality within the research confirmed the importance of commonly accepted standards such as positivity, specificity, timeliness, and encouraging active student participation. Additionally, trends and themes indicated a need for the consistent implementation of the feedback exchange process and flexibility to account for student input/preferences. Greater consistency toward the application of these quality indicators should be undertaken when determining the quality of higher education feedback for preservice teachers prior to undertaking summative licensure assessments.},

Fifty graduate students completed an online survey at the end of the semester about their awareness and perceptions of course rubrics. All students reported that they were aware that course rubrics existed. They indicated that they had learned about this information through the course syllabus, professor announcements via email and posts to LMS. Most students reported reviewing rubrics prior to submitting an assignment. One of the key findings from this study was that "students see rubrics" as a mechanism for scaffolding their performance, and thus, instructors need to focus more effort on designing rubrics to accomplish more than student assessment.},

  abstract = {This article illustrates how organizational theory can be used to support the development of authentic assessment practice among community college faculty, as well as guide research on implementation of assessment efforts. While many factors make implementing assessment difficult, the link between accreditation and assessment is a key element in distancing the practice from faculty. This dynamic arises not from the actions of accreditation agencies per se, but from the accountability narrative that has come to dominate both assessment and accreditation, the corresponding perception that assessment is ?done to? faculty rather than by them, and a reliance among institutional leaders to echo this message in an effort to get assessment started. The result is implementation of assessment for compliance rather than meaningful program improvement. Understanding assessment as an innovation, and using organizational theory to guide implementation, may help community college leaders transcend this challenge and develop assessment practice that is more faculty-owned and meaningful. However, the current literature says little about how to use organizational theory to implement such assessment efforts. This article integrates Bolman and Deal?s (2008) framework on leadership and organizational change with actual examples of practice to illustrate how their model might be used to recapture the potential of assessment as well as guide research on effective implementation.},

Close fit may indeed result from a model being close to properly causally specified, but close-fitting factor models can also be seriously causally misspecified. This article illustrates a variety of nonfactor causal worlds that are perfectly, but inappropriately, fit by factor models. Seeing nonfactor worlds that are perfectly yet erroneously fit via factor models should help researchers understand that close-to-fitting factor models may seriously misrepresent the world's causal structure. Statistical cautions regarding the factor model's proclivity to fit when it ought not to fit have been insufficiently publicized and are rarely heeded. A research commitment to understanding the world's causal structure, combined with clear examples of factor mismodeling should spur diagnostic assessment of significant factor model failures---including reassessment of published failing factor models.},

In this case, decision processes of students are understood to be nuanced by a vast range of factors with variable relevance for everyone. The effort of the study is to address how Systems Thinking, related policy development, and associated enabling techniques can be applied to the field to provide both a deeper understanding of the dictates of student behaviour and, by extension, the appropriate foci for data provision, enabling comparative business performance assessment of Higher Education Providers. This research has followed the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology; the developed model has been successfully evaluated against the understanding of education practitioners in an interview consultation process of the methodology. The analysis of interview feedback and the development and refinement of the proposed model generate the principle findings of the study.

Presumably to aid with this process, a number ofinstitutions acquired licenses to remote online proctoring services. This paper examines theresearch around online remote proctoring, examining the justification offered for the adoption ofonline remote proctoring, and contemporary research on assessment practices in higher education.Throughout the paper, I demonstrate a lack of research that speaks to the efficacy of this mode ofassessment while also acknowledging shifts in the testing environment, and an increase in studentanxiety. I argue that online remote proctoring is not only embedded within neoliberalism and auditculture, but supports a continued reliance on testing culture. It concludes with a discussion ofassessment culture, offering some alternative assessment approaches that might disrupt the veryneed for online remote proctoring.

These LMSs allow individual preparation for the students, especially in large classes. However, students' learning in these online systems is often not supported by detailed formative feedback, as the options for this in current LMSs are quite limited. Formative feedback should be connected with the learning objective or competencies of the course, but formative feedback in an LMS is limited to single tasks or tests and does not allow one to focus on competencies across tasks. We have developed two easy-to-use software tools that enable teachers to use data from the LMS to quickly create an automated formative feedback that can be sent to students. First evaluations of the average final exam scores of different classes show that this new type of formative feedback seems to have a medium-scale effect on students' final exam scores~according to Cohen.},

La nouvelle {\'E}chelle multidimensionnelle d'engagement des {\'e}tudiants dans des modalit{\'e}s de cours hybrides (EMEECH) vient outiller chercheurs et formateurs pour mesurer l'engagement des {\'e}tudiants dans ces modalit{\'e}s selon une perspective multidimensionnelle. Nous pr{\'e}sentons son {\'e}laboration ainsi que des preuves de validit{\'e} pour sa structure interne obtenues par analyses factorielles exploratoires et de coh{\'e}rence interne sur la base de donn{\'e}es diversifi{\'e}es provenant de trois institutions universitaires. Un premier {\'e}chantillon (n                                    1                                  ~=~234) a permis d'identifier trois dimensions de l'engagement des {\'e}tudiants~: {\'e}motionnelle-cognitive, sociale et comportementale. Un second {\'e}chantillon (n                                    2                                  ~=~231) a appuy{\'e} la structure interne de la nouvelle {\'e}chelle en confirmant sa structure factorielle et en pr{\'e}sentant une tr{\`e}s bonne coh{\'e}rence interne.                                       ,                                              Blended learning course environments combine synchronous activities (in face-to-face or virtual classrooms) with asynchronous online activities, and they represent a fertile ground for enhancing student engagement. However, studying student engagement in these environments requires the development of a measurement scale, which is the purpose of this paper. The new measurement scale {\'E}chelle multidimensionnelle d'engagement des {\'e}tudiants dans des modalit{\'e}s de cours hybrides (EMEECH) provides researchers and instructors with tools for assessing student engagement in blended courses (blended, blended online or blended synchronous) from a multidimensional perspective. Its elaboration is presented, accompanied by evidence of validity for its internal structure obtained through exploratory factor and internal consistency analyses based on diversified data from three academic institutions. A first sample (n                                    1                                  =234) allowed identifying three dimensions to student engagement: emotional-cognitive, social and behavioral. A second sample (n                                    2                                  =231) provided further evidence of the internal structure of the new scale by confirming its factorial structure and its very good internal consistency.                                       ,                                              As modalidades de cursos h{\'i}bridos, que combinam atividades s{\'i}ncronas (em sala de aula ou virtuais) e ass{\'i}ncronas online, representam um campo potencial para aumentar o n{\'i}vel de envolvimento dos estudantes nos seus cursos. O estudo do envolvimento dos estudantes nestas modalidades requer, em todo o caso, o desenvolvimento de uma escala de medi{\c c}{\~a}o, que {\'e} o objetivo deste artigo. A nova Escala Multidimensional para o Envolvimento dos estudantes em modalidades de cursos h{\'i}bridos (EMEECH) fornece um instrumento para investigadores e formadores medirem o envolvimento dos estudantes nestas modalidades a partir de uma perspetiva multidimensional. Apresentamos a sua elabora{\c c}{\~a}o, bem como as provas de validade da sua estrutura interna obtidas por an{\'a}lises fatoriais explorat{\'o}rias e coer{\^e}ncia interna, tendo por base diversos dados de tr{\^e}s institui{\c c}{\~o}es universit{\'a}rias. Uma primeira amostra (n                                    1                                  ~=~234) identificou tr{\^e}s dimens{\~o}es do envolvimento dos estudantes: emocional-cognitiva, social e comportamental. Uma segunda amostra (n                                    2                                  ~=~231) apoiou a estrutura interna da nova escala, confirmando a sua estrutura fatorial e apresentando uma coer{\^e}ncia interna muito boa.},

Indigenous methodologies are in line with an Indigenous paradigm, while critical and liberatory methodologies fit with the transformative paradigm. Yet Indigenous and transformative methodologies share an emancipatory and critical stance and thus are increasingly used in tandem by both Western and Indigenous scholars in an attempt to decolonize methodologies, research, and the academy as a whole. However, these multiparadigmatic spaces only superficially support decolonization which, in the Canadian context of settler colonialism, is a radical and unsettling prospect that is about land, resources, and sovereignty. Applying this definition of decolonization to the decolonization of research paradigms, this article suggests that such paradigms must be developed, from scratch, conjointly between Indigenous and Western researchers.},

Research into OER use, perceptions, costs, and outcomes is becoming more prevalent; however, it is still in its infancy. Understanding barriers to full adoption, administration, and acceptance of OER is paramount to fully supporting its growth and success in education worldwide. The purpose of this research was to replicate and extend Kursun, Cagiltay, and Can's (2014) Turkish study to include international participants. Kursun, et al. surveyed OpenCourseWare (OCW) faculty on their perceptions of OER barriers, incentives, and benefits. Through replication, these findings provide a glimpse into the reality of the international educators' perceptions of barriers, incentives, and benefits of OER use to assist in the creation of practical solutions and actions for both policy makers and educators alike. The results of this replication study indicate that barriers to OER include institutional policy, lack of incentives, and a need for more support and education in the creating, using, and sharing of instructional materials. A major benefit to OER identified by educators is the continued collegial atmosphere of sharing and lifelong learning.},

In particular, formative assessment in mathematics subjects enables both students and teaching academics to assess individual performance and understanding through students' responses. Over the last decade, educational technologies and learning management systems (LMSs) are used to support formative assessment design. In mathematics, this is problematic because of the inflexibility of LMS and educational technology tools. Automating formative assessment generation and marking to support mathematics learning is made possible by utilising specific software and technologies in new ways. This paper proposes a new method of creating mathematics formative assessments using LaTeX and PDF forms in conjunction with a computer algebra system (e.g., Maple), independent of an LMS. This method is implemented in undergraduate mathematics subjects servicing non-mathematics-focused higher education courses. The method generates individualised assessments that are automatically marked. Results show that the method provides the teaching academic with a more efficient way of designing formative mathematics assessments without compromising the effectiveness of the assessment task. This study contributes to the growing research on mathematics in higher education. The implication is an increased understanding of how existing technology, implemented in new ways, can potentially benefit both mathematics students and teaching academics.},

To ensure methodical variety in this course, educational games and quizzes have been developed, used, and evaluated. The attendance of the course, and therefore also the use of the quizzes and games, was voluntary. The quizzes' main goal was to give the students the opportunity to check whether they had memorized the knowledge needed in the course. Another goal was to make transparent which knowledge the students should memorize by rote. The evaluation shows that the students had not internalized all knowledge which they should apply in several tasks on organic chemistry. They answered multiselect questions in general less well than single-select questions. The games should combine fun with learning. The evaluation of the games shows that the students rated them very well. The students used those games again for their exam preparation, as the monitoring of accessing the games showed. Students' experiences with using electronic devices in general or for quizzes and games have also been evaluated, because their experience could influence the students' assessment of the quizzes and games used in our study. However, the students used electronic devices regularly and should therefore be technically competent to use our quizzes and games. The evaluation showed that the use of digital games for learning purposes is not very common, neither at school nor at university, although the students had worked with such tools before. The students are also very interested in using and developing such digital games not only for their own study, but also for their future work at school.},

  abstract = {Before COVID-19, the use of case studies to learn science was well established in high school and postsecondary classrooms. Once the pandemic ensued, many faculty continued to use the method as a way to infuse elements of active learning remotely. The results of a survey taken by 600 faculty reveal how they accomplished this feat. Respondents to the survey found that the case method readily transferred to online learning. Most used a mixture of synchronous and asynchronous classrooms. Serious challenges were encountered, primarily due to the difficulty instructors had in keeping track of learner participation. Many obstacles were overcome by creative strategies such as using Google Forms. Some semblance of a normal classroom was achieved by using online conferencing tools and using small groups in synchronous breakout rooms. Cases were commonly broken into chunks and spread over several days. This worked especially well with cases that were already structured this way, including interrupted cases and problem-based learning exercises. Assessment of student performance largely followed the traditional path of exams, projects, and essays, although a third of the faculty attempted to evaluate participation. Classes conducted via an asynchronous approach were largely lecture based, with cases given to learners to complete as homework either individually or as groups. The greatest challenge in this setting was that answers to case questions were often readily available to learners on the internet. This was avoided by faculty modifying questions or creating their own.},

Students then discuss their work with instructors and peers in threaded comments. gPortfolios usually include engagement reflections, formative self-assessments and automated quizzes. These assessments support and document learning while avoiding instructor ``burnout'' from grading. gPortfolios can be implemented using Google Docs and Forms or any learning management system.                                         Design/methodology/approach               The authors report practical insights gained from design-based implementation research. This research explored the late Randi Engle's principles for productive disciplinary engagement and expansive framing. Engle used current theories of learning to foster student discussions that were both authentic to the academic discipline at hand and productive for learning. This research also used new approaches to assessment to support Engle's principles. This resulted in a comprehensive approach to online instruction and assessment that is effective and efficient for both students and teachers.                                         Findings               The approach ``frames'' (i.e. contextualizes) online engagement using each learners' own experiences, perspectives and goals. Writing this revealed how this was different in different courses. Secondary biology students framed each assignment independently. Secondary English and history students framed assignments as elements of a personalized capstone presentation; the history students further used a self-selected ``historical theme.'' Graduate students framed each assignment in an educational assessment course using a real or imagined curricular aim and context.                                         Originality/value               Engle's ideas have yet to be widely taken up in online education.},

We reimagined grading, assessment, and testing in an extended program of design-based research using situative theory to refine online courses in secondary, undergraduate, graduate, and technical contexts. This research minimized private instructor-student interactions (including grading and private formative feedback) while maximizing public interactions. We present 10 assessment design principles, including a new principle concerning diversity and equity. We assume that these principles will be new to many readers and counter-intuitive to some. These principles focus on assessment functions (rather than ostensible purposes) and align learning across increasingly formal levels. We argue that doing so can maximize formative and transformative assessment functions, position students as authors, rather than consumers, reposition minoritized students to empower them, and increase validity and credibility of evidence.},

We argue that these falsehoods, and the overall activity of large language models, is better understood as bullshit in the sense explored by Frankfurt (On Bullshit, Princeton, 2005): the models are in an important way indifferent to the truth of their outputs. We distinguish two ways in which the models can be said to be bullshitters, and argue that they clearly meet at least one of these definitions. We further argue that describing AI misrepresentations as bullshit is both a more useful and more accurate way of predicting and discussing the behaviour of these systems.},

Adopting aspects of a constructivist theory of learning, it is seen that formative assessment feedback is essential to encourage the kind of 'deep' learning desired by tutors. There are a number of barriers to the utility of feedback outside the sphere of control of individual students, including those relating to the quality, quantity and language of comments. But the students in the study seemed to read and value their tutors' comments. Their perceptions of feedback do not indicate that they are simply instrumental 'consumers' of education, driven solely by the extrinsic motivation of the mark and as such desire feedback which simply provides them with 'correct answers'. Rather, the situation is more complex. While recognising the importance of grades, many of the students in the study adopt a more 'conscientious' approach. They are motivate...},

Reprinted by permission of Routledge, Taylor \& Francis Ltd.;"Idle No More" represents a watershed moment of treaty education, with treaty-related teach-ins, direct actions, and information sharing happening in diverse public spaces across Canada and around the globe. Although unprecedented in scope, depth, and intensity, "Idle No More" rests in a centuries-old continuity of Indigenous treaty pedagogy: efforts on the part of Indigenous peoples, going back to the time of first contact, to educate newcomers to their territories regarding the principles, meanings, protocol, and implications of treaty relationships. Yet despite centuries of such efforts, as well as more recent efforts on the part of solidarity organizations and even mainstream educational institutions, treaty ignorance and denial remain rampant in Canada, and treaties themselves continue to constitute a lightning rod of contention and entrenched conflict between Indigenous and settler peoples. For critical educators committed to dismantling colonial mindsets, practices, and structures, then, the question remains: given the entrenched nature of this dominant treaty pedagogy, how might it be possible to prompt a "decolonizing treaty" (Sehdev 2011, 273) consciousness among non-Indigenous people? What kinds of critical praxis might disrupt mythologizing settler narratives and the colonial discourses and practices conducive of ignorance and denial? Further, given Tuck and Yang's (2012) admonition that "decolonization is not a metaphor", what forms of reflection and action might foster and support concrete efforts among settlers to bring about a full and just recognition of treaty rights, relationships, and responsibilities? To explore these questions, Chris Hiller begins by reflecting upon interviews with Euro-Canadian solidarity activists who have been engaged for at least two years in supporting Indigenous struggles over land, title, and sovereignty. For the purpose of this article, Hiller focuses on the narratives of five white settlers whose stories pivot on engagements with the meaning and implications of the treaties and treaty relationships. The article concludes with a discussion of what the narratives as a whole say about the role of situated forms of treaty praxis in processes of decolonizing settler attitudes, practices, and commitments.;},

However, previous research has shown how academic dishonesty is more prevalent under these modalities. Therefore, there is the challenge of performing trustworthy remote assessments, in order to obtain valid and reliable measures of students' knowledge. Objectives The research question that drove this research was: what actions have been proposed in contemporary research to improve remote assessment trustworthiness from a technological and pedagogical perspective? Methods We analysed the papers accepted for the special issue titled `Trustworthy Assessment and Academic Integrity in Remote Learning' following a deductive qualitative category coding methodology to find the main approaches. Results and conclusions We identified eight approaches to improve trustworthiness in remote assessment: four for exams and high-stake tests, one exclusively for performance-based assessments, and three for any type of assessment. Our findings shift attention from academic dishonesty to trustworthy assessment, integrating recent findings of papers accepted to this special issue. Implications Our findings deepen current understanding of trustworthy remote assessments, inviting practitioners and researchers to explore different types of assessment methods and different moments related to assessing learning.

We argue that attempting to analyze Native American traditions through Western theory will only work towards colonizing these Indigenous texts. Thus, whereas we employ insights from digital and visual methods of analysis (Highfield, T., \& Leaver, T.~(2016). Instagrammatics and digital methods: Studying visual social media, from selfies and GIFs to memes and emoji. Communication Research and Practice, 2(1), 47?62), we also highlight the strategic use of humor in the visual materials shared through various social media platforms utilizing the framework of the Trickster. We argue that the visual and digital phenomena we studied might best be understood as a form of digital survivance, drawing upon Anishinaabe scholar Gerald Vizenor [(1994). Manifest manners: Postindian warriors of survivance. Hanover, CT: Wesleyan University Press]. term ?survivance? as a portmanteau that combines ?survival? and ?resistance? in its characterization of Indigenous storytelling traditions. Whereas centering the Indigenous figure of the Trickster might suggest that social media has failed to live up to its promises, this epistemological approach also explains the hope that Indigenous communities hold in uniting via social media for what has been and continues to be a long-term battle for sovereignty and for the protection of the earth and all of its beings.},

While scholars have noted conceptual overlap between transformational leadership and these newer leadership forms, there has been inadequate investigation of the empirical relationships with transformational leadership and the ability (or lack thereof) of these leadership forms to explain incremental variance beyond transformational leadership. In response, we conducted a series of meta-analyses to provide a comprehensive assessment of these emerging leadership forms' relationships with variables evaluated in the extant literature. Second, we tested the relative performance of each of these leadership forms in explaining incremental variance, beyond transformational leadership, in nine outcomes. We also provide relative weights analyses to further evaluate the relative contributions of the emerging leadership forms versus transformational leadership. The high correlations between both authentic leadership and ethical leadership with transformational leadership coupled with their low amounts of incremental variance suggest that their utility is low unless they are being used to explore very specific outcomes. Servant leadership, however, showed more promise as a stand-alone leadership approach that is capable of helping leadership researchers and practitioners better explain a wide range of outcomes. Guidance regarding future research and the utility of these three ethical/moral values--based leadership forms is provided.}

For some time now, the affordances provided by the internet have enabled a range of educational activities to be supported digitally or conducted online. Three fairly new forms of web-enabled activities that are receiving attention are Open Educational Resources (OER), Open Textbooks, and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). OERs and Open Textbooks have been hailed as a response to the demand for provision of flexible and cost-effective learning materials, while MOOCs have been touted as an answer to the provision of up-to-date and cost-effective tuition for growing numbers of students in so-called `developing countries', or what I shall refer to as the Global South. This paper will offer a definition of these forms of teaching provision and learning support within the context of ``Open Education'' and identify the key activities underlying OER, Open Textbooks and MOOCs. It will interrogate the factors that seem to influence the ease with which educators and students in the Global South can contribute to or adapt existing materials and/or tuition to suit their contexts as a way to avoid any possible ``neo-colonization and one-way flow of content based on the massive amount of content published by those in richer nations'' (Amiel 2013: 127).}

This under-representation is a direct result of the lack of academic success in science and mathematics, an issue that begins early in elementary and middle school and often escalates in secondary school with the majority consequently doing poorly, not completing these courses and often dropping out. This makes them ineligible to pursue STEM-related paths at the post-secondary level. The greatest challenges to success in these courses are the lack of relevancy for Aboriginal learners and, as importantly, how they are taught; impediments that are also paramount to the increasing lack of success for many non-Aboriginal students in STEM-related courses. This paper explores how Aboriginal ways of knowing and learning and those of the 21st century learners of today very closely parallel each other and illustrates how the creative multidisciplinary approach of a liberal education might be the way to enable early academic engagement, success and retention of Aboriginal learners in the sciences and mathematics.},

Research on the use and design of interactive Web 2.0 platforms for informal learning is minimal, and often platform-specific. This theory-building metasynthesis aims to identify what is known about how informal online learning can be effectively designed outside a formal online course structure. The study reviewed 22 articles that investigated learning that happened primarily online, was self-directed in nature, and had a primarily adult audience. The author brought together the findings of these individual studies to identified two effective principles of informal online learning design that research dissemination organizations can utilize when developing online outreach education programs for adult audiences: (a) interaction opportunities support knowledge construction and learner empowerment; and (b) segmented, titled, and tagged learning objects facilitate personalized learning. The principles identified in this study not only describe what is known about how adults learn informally online, but also provide the common language and goals to frame the interdisciplinary collaboration likely necessary to employ them.}

We argue that these developments are not pushing mathematics education in the same direction, however, which creates tensions. Mathematics education-so essential for educating young people to be creative and problem solving agents in the twenty-first century-is at risk of focusing too much on assessment of lower order goals, such as the reproduction of procedural, calculation based, knowledge and skills. While there is an availability of an increasing amount of sophisticated technology, the related advances in measurement, creation and delivery of automated assessments of mathematics are however being based on sequences of atomised test items. In this article several aspects of the use of technology in the assessment of mathematics education are exemplified and discussed, including in relation to the aforementioned tension. A way forward is suggested by the introduction of a framework for the categorisation of mathematical problem situations with an increasing sophistication of representing the problem situation using various aspects of technology. The framework could be used to reflect on and discuss mathematical assessment tasks, especially in relation to twenty-first century skills.},

The effectiveness and success of e-learning programs are dependent on facilitators' roles in delivering and managing instruction. One of the leading conceptualizers in the field of distance learning, Zane Berge, broke down an instructor's role in computer conferencing into four separate parts. I propose a similar model, in which an e-learning facilitator "wears four pairs of shoes"--acting as instructor, social director, program manager, and technical assistant.}

The authors applied the argument-based approach to validation to the context of formative assessment. This resulted in a proposed interpretation and use argument consisting of a score interpretation and a score use. The former involves inferences linking specific task performance to an interpretation of a student's general performance. The latter involves inferences regarding decisions about actions and educational consequences. The validity argument should focus on critical claims regarding score interpretation and score use, since both are critical to the effectiveness of formative assessment. The proposed framework is illustrated by an operational example including a presentation of evidence that can be collected on the basis of the framework.},

I would also argue that such tests may no longer reflect the reality of language assessment today since they are generic and context independent. Following Gotch and French (2014), I would argue that the present treatment of LAK, which is based on summative normative principles, might not be construct valid anymore. I will conclude the paper with suggesting a cross contextual framework that will hopefully represent a clear picture of the complex dimensions of LAK and lead to further research in this direction.}

Importantly, flexible approaches to online learning are purported to be democratizing and liberatory, broadening access to higher education and enabling learners to participate in educational endeavours at ?anytime? from ?anyplace.? In this paper, we critique such narratives by showing that flexibility is neither universal nor neutral. Using critical theory, we demonstrate how flexibility assumes imagined autonomous learners that are self-reliant and individualistic. Through relevant examples, we show how such a framing to flexibility is oppressive, and argue that a contextual, relative and relational understanding of flexibility may in fact be more liberatory. Such an approach to flexibility, for example, may involve contextual and relational efforts to relax prescribed curricula within courses or programmes of study.}

  abstract = {Educational systems generate huge quantities of digital data. Digital educational data is captured and used at all points -- from classrooms and schools, to the level of educational departments. As growing trends in `data-driven instruction' suggest, all these data have great potential to support student, teacher and leadership practices, help guide work and learning decisions, and inform policy development. Moreover, an increasing focus is being placed on the development of artificial intelligence to automate and improve how data are used. Yet, stakeholder data practices remain invisible and little understood, which complicates how artificial intelligence can be embedded in this context. In this paper, we introduce an educational data journeys framework to frame dynamics of data power, data work, identities and literacies. This approach is employed to explore educational policy revealing data flows and frictions in school improvement and implications for the development of artificial intelligence in education.},

However, most previous technology-enhanced learning studies for dance education mainly focused on students' dance skills, while the issue concerning the approaches to promoting students' choreographic performance has generally been ignored. To address this issue, the present study developed a mobile technology-assisted peer assessment approach based on social constructivism for use in a university general education dance routine choreography class. A total of 266 university students were divided into an experimental group and a control group. The experiment lasted for 15~weeks and involved two rounds of peer assessment. The results showed that mobile peer assessment could significantly enhance the innovative competence of dance routines and dance skills. In addition, according to the students' feedback, the dance routine choreography class was conducive to improving social skills, innovative competence, and intrinsic motivation, while mobile peer assessment could assist students in understanding accurate evaluation criteria, reflecting on their own in a more objective way, and broadening the aspects of appreciating the work.},

Students should be able to use and manage both existing and emerging technologies effectively and be able to apply associated pedagogies to suit the environment, but also evaluate and manage technological advances of future and the requisite pedagogical shifts to achieve efficiency and effectiveness. The demand of educational technology has been rising steadily, primarily due to the fact that e-learning is a huge and significantly expanding world-wide industry. Commercial e-learning companies, training departments in large companies and organizations, computer software companies and educational institutions the world over employ large numbers of educational technology specialists. There is a strong demand for technologists who understand educational theories and for instructional designers and teachers who understand technologies. This book is targeted towards those who are looking for career in educational technology, instructional design, or media and information systems, or may want to continue their studies in graduate programs in learning and instructional technology, and those who are interested in becoming teacher in K-12 setting but need background in educational technology. This book will also act as a valuable resource in teacher education programs where primary focus on mainstream education and requires an authentic resource in instructional design and educational technology. Keeping in mind the varied needs of the organizations, employees and potential students, this book adopts a competency approach to learning and assessment. The themes and topics take a multi-disciplinary approach, and are aimed at preparing students for competent and innovative educational technology professionals.},

Here, we describe the major successes and challenges encountered during the full implementation of online chemistry instruction in higher education in China based on questionnaires answered by 56 teachers and 432 students in two universities. In addition to describing the impacts of online chemistry instruction on teachers, students, chemistry experiments, student assessments, and technology, our work seeks to provide insights into how teachers, students, and technologies rise to meet the challenges in this difficult time. Our survey indicates the common challenges for teachers and students that arise from no face-to-face interaction in online instruction. Apart from that, teachers have to be familiar with internet-based technologies and online teaching tools, adjust their teaching plans and teaching methods, and quickly adapt to the new situation. Teachers also need to improve their teacher--student interaction and maintain student interest and engagement during online teaching. To become a successful online learner, students need to be more proactive and self-disciplined. In addition, an effective online teaching method for chemistry experiments has been proposed. While teachers and students still prefer classroom education, the vast majority of them are satisfied with the online chemistry course with significant support from technologies and online platforms.},

The purpose of this paper is to understand the benefits students are receiving from e-assessment as well as the complications they are facing when institutions are adapting e-assessment and switching from traditional assessment. The paper is based on the views of a small sample of university students chosen randomly, which found mixed reactions to e-assessment. Although students appreciate the importance of e-assessment, they have some fears about technology-based examinations as all of them do not have an equal level of IT competence. Further research should be carried out to explore other aspects of e-assessment in the higher education context.},

None-theless, these massive open online learning communities regularly draw far more engaged users than the typical MOOC. Their informal structure, however, makes them significantly more difficult to study. In this work, we take a first step toward attempting to understand these communi-ties specifically from the perspective of scale. Taking a sample of 62 such communities, we develop a tagging sys-tem for understanding the specific features and how they relate to scale. For example, just as a MOOC cannot man-ually grade every assignment, so also an informal learning community cannot approve every contribution; and just as MOOCs therefore employ autograding, informal learning communities employ crowd-sourced moderation or plat-form-driven enforcement. Using these tags, we then select several communities for deeper case studies. We also use these tags to make sense of learning-based subreddits from the popular community site Reddit, which offers an API for programmatic analysis. Based on these techniques, we offer findings about the performance of informal learning communities at scale and issue a call to include these envi-ronments more fully in future research on learning at scale.},

  abstract = {COVID-19 is hastening the adoption of online learning and teaching worldwide, and across all levels of education. While many of the typical learning and teaching transactions such as lecturing and communicating are easily handled by contemporary online learning technologies, others, such as assessment of learning outcomes with closed book examinations are fraught with challenges. Among other issues to do with students and teachers, these challenges have to do with the ability of teachers and educational organizations to ensure academic integrity in the absence of a live proctor when an examination is being taken remotely and from a private location. A number of online proctoring tools are appearing on the market that portend to offer solutions to some of the major challenges. But for the moment, they too remain untried and tested on any large scale. This includes the cost of the service and their technical requirements. This paper reports on one of the first attempts to properly evaluate a selection of these tools and offer recommendations for educational institutions. This investigation, which was carried out at the University of the South Pacific, comprised a four-phased approach, starting with desk research that was followed with pilot testing by a group of experts as well as students. The elimination of a tool in every phase was based on the 'survival of the fittest' approach with each phase building upon the milestones and deliverables from the previous phase. This paper presents the results of this investigation and discusses its key findings.},

Although academic and student affairs share a common goal of supporting student success, they frequently do not speak the same assessment language. This lack of alignment can lead to miscommunication and missed opportunities to collaboratively promote learning and achievement. Further, it can be a struggle to implement assessment protocols if institutional stakeholders do not value and believe in the importance of their role in the assessment process. In this paper, we discuss how professionals at an online academic success center used the Theory of Planned Behavior to inform and improve an assessment protocol as part of the institution's overall assessment plan. The steps and strategies used over multiple assessment loops are discussed to demonstrate the path taken to build a collaborative learning environment for students in and out of the online classroom.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This paper presents findings from a case study on the impact of high stakes oral performance assessment on third year mathematics students' approaches to learning (Entwistle and Ramsden, Understanding student learning, 1983). We choose oral performance assessment as this mode of assessment differs substantially from written exams for its dialogic nature and because variation of assessment methods is seen to be very important in an otherwise very uniform assessment diet. We found that students perceived the assessment to require conceptual understanding over memory and were more likely to employ revision strategies conducive to deep learning (akin to conceptual understanding) when preparing for the oral performance assessment than when preparing for a written exam. Moreover, they reported to have engaged and interacted in lectures more than they would have otherwise, another characteristic conducive to deep learning approaches. We conclude by suggesting some implications for the summative assessment of mathematics at university level.},

  abstract = {The pending challenge of assessment in higher education, although also at other educational levels, continues to be its effective link with student learning. Students' strategic learning could and should be achieved by the assessment. This paper arises from the attempt to answer the question about what would be the future of assessment in higher education and it is presented under the form of a collaborative text that was elaborated by all the authors who sign it. This contribution offers a joint reflection by various authors from different contexts and regions on three essential aspects. First, the need for reflection and a change in assessment based on current trends that are demonstrating their timeliness and validity is highlighted. A second issue focuses on the value of technology for the changes that are taking place on assessment, but as long as it adapts to its principles and, therefore, does not imply a return to the last century under the dominance of models today widely overcome. Together with the use of technology-enhanced assessment, the interrelationship between assessment and learning implies to redesign assessment practices, to incorporate proposals from the fields of social justice and sustainable assessment, the design of authentic assessment tasks, to promote feedback and encourage students' participation. In brief, to collaborate to develop the students' evaluative judgment in order to achieve free, socially responsible and fair citizens.},

Advances in knowledge of assessment processes have shown the need to have a greater breadth and diversity of methods and instruments that allow the collection of thorough and valid information on which to base judgments about the level of learning in students. Within the framework of the FLOASS Project, this study has been carried out in order to explore the perception that teachers have of their assessment practice. A mixed methodology has been used, through an exploratory sequential design, which has allowed to gather the perception of 416 professors from six universities belonging to different autonomous communities, who completed the RAPEVA questionnaire - Self-report of the teaching staff on their practice in the learning outcomes assessment. Among the most widely used methods, participation, problem solving tests, performance tests, digital objects or multimedia presentations and projects and rubrics or evaluative arguments are highlighted among the assessment instruments. The greatest differences were found depending on the university, the field of knowledge or the degree of security and satisfaction with the assessment system. In the case of gender or experience, differences are small or non-existent. Future lines of research that enable a better understanding of assessment practice in higher education are provided.},

Therefore, self and peer assessments are to become a core aspect of student-centred evaluation processes in Higher Education. Besides, a high concordance with lecturer evaluation may allow lecturers to also benefit from self and peer evaluation without an increase in their workload. In the present work, we compare the formative evaluation from the lecturer with the self and peer assessments through a virtual learning environment. The subject of study if formed by assessments prepared by students in a first-year course in a Social Sciences degree at the Universidade de Vigo, Spain. We find a strong concordance between peer assessment and lecturer assignment, and a moderate agreement between self-assessment and lecturer assignment. These results show that students perform well as peer evaluators, with peer assignment being a procedure with high validity and reliability.},

With the introduction of online learning, the anytime/anywhere mantra taken up by many postsecondary institutions was a first step to meeting learner needs for flexibility; however, the choice and determination of delivery mode still resides with the institution and course instructors. Recently, the massive open online course (MOOC) movement has been introduced as an undeniable force in higher education, and the authors argue that it is distracting leadership from focusing on alternative options for supporting the needs of learners who demand both personalization and real access to learning opportunities. The key element to the MOOC movement is its openness that enables student access to education. In this article, the authors present the multi-access learning framework that envelops the MOOC phenomenon and merges course access modes enabling student choice and agency. The authors report results from a pilot study on one type of multi-access course, where students were able to choose their mode of access. In this case, remote students accessed the course via webcam and joined their on-campus classmates and instructor who were together face-to-face. Implications for multi-access learning in relation to the MOOC movement are discussed.},

The fundamental purpose of the study was to contextualize the assessment system from primary to higher institutions and an examination of recent changes by the educational authorities. It began with a quick history of the examination system, summative assessment, and explained the current education system and the evaluation process in education. The data obtained from the Punjab Examination Commission (PEC) of 5th and 8th grade, from the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) of 9th grade, and the Punjab University for the undergraduate level was used to evaluate the instructional and examination methods. Results showed poor performance, especially in English, as it was not taught by applying modern and effective teaching methods. The outdated evaluation process and inadequate curricula are factors for poor performance.},

Overt policies encouraging educators to adopt e-Learning and implement digital services coupled with the dramatic change in the education system in response to the challenges posed by COVID-19, has furthered the demand for evidence-based approaches for the planning and delivery of assessments. This study employed the Assessment Design Decision Framework (ADDF), a theoretical model that considers key aspects of assessment design, to retrospectively investigate from a multi-stakeholder perspective the assessments implemented following the rapid transition to remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. One-to-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with faculty and students from the Colleges of Pharmacy, Medicine and Health Sciences. After inductive and deductive thematic analysis three major themes were identified. These reflected on the impact of sudden transition on assessment design and assessment plan; changing assessment environment; and faculty-student assessment related interactions which included feedback. The use of a comprehensive validated framework such as ADDF, to plan assessments can improve validity and credibility of assessments. The strengths of this study lie in the innovative adoption of the ADDF to evaluate assessment design decisions from both an educator and student perspective. Further, the data yielded from this study offers novel validation of the use of ADDF in circumstances necessitating rapid transition, and additionally identifies a need for greater emphasis to be attributed to the significance of timeliness of the various activities that are advocated within the framework.},

This assessment approach leverages the open response format of human-to-human conversations -- similar to constructed response items -- in order to allow students to express their thoughts and ideas using their own words. Additionally, CBAs are highly interactive -- similar to simulations -- and contain automatically adapted dialogue structures. Both of these features allow for the collection of new types of explanatory evidence that potentially afford greater insight into student cognition and metacognition. In this chapter we discuss CBAs in more detail, provide an augmented framework to contrast CBAs and other kinds of assessment tasks, and illustrate the power of CBAs through two sub-tasks from a recently developed assessment prototype.},

The escalating demand for Internet-based, distance education courses has been met by an increased inventory of them. However, while online education has been in existence for over a decade, standardized practices in the online classroom have not been fully identified, developed, and implemented. Data was collected from student evaluations of two web-based courses at two Texas community colleges. Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations and multiple regressions were used to identify faculty behaviors which affected the satisfaction of students enrolled in these courses. The results of the study indicated that faculty actions within online courses appeared to impact student satisfaction. The identification of faculty actions which impact student satisfaction in online courses will greatly assist colleges and universities in strengthening their abilities to provide quality online experiences for their students.

However, if scenario-based online construction safety quizzes do not include time pressure similar to real-world situations, they reflect situations too ideally. The purpose of this paper is to compare engineering students' performance when carrying out an online construction safety quiz with time pressure versus an online construction safety quiz without time pressure. Two versions of an online construction safety quiz are developed and administered to randomly assigned engineering students based on a quasi-experimental post-test design. The findings contribute to scenario-based learning and assessment of construction safety in four ways. First, the results confirm earlier findings that 'intrinsic stress' does not seem to impair students' performance. Second, students who carry out the online construction safety quiz with time pressure are less likely to 'learn by trial and error'. Third, students exposed to time pressure appreciate that they become better prepared for real life. Finally, preparing students to work under time pressure is an important industry requirement. The results of this study should encourage engineering educators to explore and implement ways to include time pressure in scenario-based online quizzes and learning.},

While many online learning quality rubrics do exist, thus far there has been little empirical evidence establishing a clear link between specific course design features and concrete, student-level course outcomes. In the current study, the authors develop an online course design assessment rubric that includes four areas, and explore the impact of each area on student end-of semester performance in 23 online courses at two community colleges. The results indicate that the quality of interpersonal interaction within a course relates positively and significantly to student grades. Additional analyses based on course observation and interview data suggest that frequent and effective student instructor interaction creates an online environment that encourages students to commit themselves to the course and perform at a stronger academic level.

While there was social distance, there was a shared experience throughout higher education---of adaptation and pivoting--- to continue the teaching and learning endeavor. At the end of September 2021 through October 2021, a survey was conducted by Dr. Natasha Jankowski, former executive director of the National Institute for Learning Outcomes Assessment (NILOA) and Dr. Divya Bheda of ExamSoft Worldwide LLC, in partnership with Dr. Gianina Baker of NILOA. The purpose of the survey was to explore what could be learned from the various shifts and changes to assessment-related processes and practices undertaken in response to COVID-19 in order to inform the future of assessment. Higher education colleagues were invited to share their experiences and help imagine the future of assessment. Over 800 responses were collected and analyzed. Respondents spanned all roles in higher education---students, staff, faculty, administrators and leaders of various capacities including assessment---as well as all institutional types. This report provides insights as well as ideas to explore as higher education moves forward and the future of assessment is shaped. Our report serves two functions. First, it serves as a means to share high-level findings and responses to the survey. Second, it serves as a guide to planning and ideation around the future of teaching, learning, and assessment; informed by the responses and what was learned from the findings. As such, it is divided into two main sections: findings and imagining a new future. Throughout 2022, readers are invited to participate in a series of discussions and thought papers on the ideas presented in the report.},

This study reports on the use of an authentic assessment for learning to develop students' digital creativity in an undergraduate competency-based accounting course. It documents the design and development of the assessment and analyses the students' digital creative outputs as well as lived experiences. Although many of the outputs were at a lower level of digital creativity, most of the students appear to have experienced the process positively and gained insight into their course material and need for digital creativity in accounting. The design of the authentic assessment can inform the development of similar assessments in other disciplinary settings.},

Following our earlier conceptual and empirical work on the social aspect of motivating and regulating learning (Hadwin \& J{\"a}rvel{\"a}, 2011; J{\"a}rvenoja \& J{\"a}rvel{\"a}, 2009; J{\"a}rvel{\"a}, Volet, \& J{\"a}rvenoja, 2010), our research questions are as follows: (a) What challenges do individuals and groups report experiencing during collaborative group work? (b) How do students collectively regulate these challenges at the time, and in future collaborations? (c) How do collaborative learning outcomes compare between groups with varying degrees of emerging shared regulation? We present an empirical study in which 18 graduate students worked in collaborative teams of 3-4 over an 8-week period. The nStudy (Winne, Hadwin, \& Beaudoin, 2010) software was used for collaborative planning and work, as well as face-to-face and online collaboration between team members. Data included individual and collaborative statements about collaborative challenges, collaborative statements about contextual and future regulation strategies, collaborative learning performance, and log file traces of students' contributions to collaborative chat discussions and planning activities. Findings indicated that the students expressed multiple challenges resulting in 3 kinds of regulation over time profiles: strong, progressive, and weak shared regulation. We also conclude that successful collaboration not only requires self-regulation but also allows each team member to support fellow team members to successfully regulate their learning and the team to come together to collectively regulate learning.

Nevertheless, few studies examine the effectiveness and efficiency of CSCL with respect to cognitive, motivational, emotional, and social issues, despite the fact that the role of regulatory processes is critical for the quality of students' engagement in collaborative learning settings. We review the four earlier lines in developing support in CSCL and show how there has been a lack of work to support individuals in groups to engage in, sustain, and productively regulate their own and the group's collaborative processes. Our aim is to discuss how our conceptual work in socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) contributes to effective and efficient CSCL, what tools are presently available, and what the implications of research on these tools are for future tool development.},

Active learning strategies are receiving increased attention as an important tool, and particularly online-based formative assessment interfaces, although challenges to their use remain in sustainable and flipped STEM education. In this research, we observed pre-service teachers' (PSTs') performance and motivation in a university STEM course that was planned as a randomized examination of 71 students during a 2017/2018 course with an online interface for sustainable and flipped formative assessment. In terms of PSTs' standardized performance and the motivation effect survey, we gathered and examined the data to observe pre- and post-test results on adaptive assignments. Additionally, feedback from/to instructors and their log records were recorded by the proposed interface. The results demonstrate the PSTs' positive performance and motivation, and the feedback and log records reiterate its positive influence with 98.6\% participation in the sustainable and flipped online formative assessment interface. Consequently, the foremost drawbacks and challenges that current and traditional STEM education are facing are meaningfully reflected by the results obtained. Thus, the platform allows PSTs to be more involved in experimental contexts and validates learning performance, and the motivations effect survey provides a sustainable and active learning methodology for their future profession.},

Similarly, although the negative impact of commercial textbook costs on student outcomes is well documented within the United States, it is unknown whether these trends generalize to the Canadian post-secondary context. The present study involves a survey of 320 post-secondary students in British Columbia enrolled in courses using an open textbook during the Spring 2015, Summer 2015, and Fall 2015 semesters. The survey investigates students' textbook purchasing behaviours, including whether, where, and in what format(s) they purchase and access their required textbooks; the negative impact of textbook costs on their course enrolment, persistence, and performance; how they access and use their open textbook, including their format preferences and study habits; and their perceptions of their open textbook, including its quality and what features they like and dislike.

Though the pandemic leads to a lot of pressure related to instruction, learning, and assessment, it also provides opportunities that are likely to require changes to the current theories and practices as well as the assumptions that are no longer justified. It is hoped that the challenges will motivate our field and the instructional experts to work closely together with the learning and instruction process so that assessment will be better integrated and can provide data-driven insights related to the sequence and content of instruction based on the diagnosis of students' strengths and weaknesses from assessment data. We expect that the integration of assessment in learning and instruction will definitely exert significant positive impact on learning outcomes. We believe the field will become aware of the assessment issues that teaching at a distance presents and will come up with innovative solutions to the many emerging problems when the world of instruction and learning undergoes significant changes from social distancing. This paper provides comments, and predictions about what the challenges and directions in educational assessment will be.},

It does not assume that the recruitment marketplace is a level playing field for graduates.

However, it makes a case that digital social production as a graduate attribute could be positioned within the body of scholarly literature that is emerging about the merits of using Wikipedia in the higher education classroom. If fewer opportunities exist for work placement and institutionally-organised internships for students taking non-vocational more generalist degrees, then students and educators must be more creative about the kinds of authentic assessment tasks and extra-curriculum activities that are on offer to shape a narrative of employability for graduates. A case is made that, following Deuze (2007), a 'networked reputation' has value in an ethical economy but potentially it could also have value in the graduate recruitment marketplace. Following Kuehn and Corrigan (2013), this paper makes a case that volunteering one's time in an unpaid internship or editing Wikipedia entries online could be categorised as 'hope labour'.},

It explains conceptually what cooperative learning is and what makes it work. Cooperative learning is presented as a technique that helps raise the achievement of all students; helps build positive relationships among students; and gives students experiences necessary for healthy social, psychological, and cognitive development. Cooperative learning replaces the mass-production, competitive organizational structure of most classrooms and schools with a team-based, high-performance organizational structure. In most classrooms, it is recommended that cooperative learning be used 60 to 80 percent of the time. The teacher's role in implementing cooperative learning includes: (1) pre-instructional decisions (selecting instructional materials and objectives, assigning students to groups, arranging the classroom, and assigning roles); (2) taskwork and teamwork (explaining the academic task, structuring positive interdependence, and specifying desired behaviors); (3) executing the cooperative lesson, which includes monitoring students' behavior and providing closure; and (4) post-lesson activities (evaluating the quality and quantity of learning, and analyzing group effectiveness).

There has never been a comprehensive review of the research on the effectiveness in increasing achievement of the methods of cooperative learning used in schools. An extensive search found 164 studies investigating eight cooperative learning methods. The studies yielded 194 independent effect sizes representing academic achievement. All eight cooperative learning methods had a significant positive impact on student achievement. When the impact of cooperative learning was compared with competitive learning, Learning Together (LT) promoted the greatest effect, followed by Academic Controversy (AC), Student-Team-Achievement-Divisions (STAD), Teams-Games-Tournaments (TGT), Group Investigation (GI), Jigsaw, Teams-Assisted-Individualization (TAI), and finally Cooperative Integrated Reading and Composition (CIRC).

  abstract = {Despite the considerable evidence that cooperation promotes higher individual achievement and greater group productivity than do competitive or individualistic situations, there are conditions under which the opposite may be true. The relative impact of positive goal interdependence and positive resource interdependence on individual achievement and group productivity in a computer-assisted problem-solving task was investigated. Forty-four Black American high school seniors and college freshmen, stratified for ability, sex, and urban or rural background, were randomly assigned to conditions. Positive goal interdependence promoted higher individual achievement and group productivity than did no goal interdependence. The combination of positive goal and resource interdependence promoted higher individual achievement and group productivity than did any of the other conditions, indicating that two sources of positive interdependence are more powerful than one. When used in isolation from positive goal interdependence, positive resource interdependence produced the lowest individual achievement and problem-solving success.

Placing teachers in small, cooperative groups to discuss the material being presented in the inservice program provide the structure and mechanisms for them to give each other support and assistance while the material is tried out and integrated into their instructional activities. Cooperative learning experiences promote more positive attitudes toward the knowledge and skills being learned than do competitive and individualistic learning experiences. There is evidence that cooperative learning promotes higher levels of motivation and personal efficacy, and results in more positive peer relationships. The implications of using cooperative learning activities goes beyond the successful implementation of a new set of teaching strategies. As teachers and administrators become more skillful in interacting with each other in collaborative activities, their interactions with students and parents will become more constructive and effective.},

In doing this, we briefly review the paradigm ``wars'' and incompatibility thesis, we show some commonalities between quantitative and qualitative research, we explain the tenets of pragmatism, we explain the fundamental principle of mixed research and how to apply it, we provide specific sets of designs for the two major types of mixed methods research ( mixed-model designs and mixed-method designs), and, finally, we explain mixed methods research as following (recursively) an eight-step process. A key feature of mixed methods research is its methodological pluralism or eclecticism, which frequently results in superior research (compared to monomethod research). Mixed methods research will be successful as more investigators study and help advance its concepts and as they regularly practice it.},

  abstract = {For a number of reasons, increasing reliance is being placed on teacher assessment in high-stakes contexts in many countries around the world. Simultaneously, countries that have for some time relied to greater or lesser degrees on teacher assessment for high-stakes purposes are in the process of questioning the validity of that reliance. In principle, teacher assessment has an important role to play in increasing assessment validity by complementing testing to cover subject domains more comprehensively than otherwise would be possible. But what is the evidence regarding the reliability of teacher assessment in high-stakes contexts? The answer is that the evidence is limited and often ambiguous. Research has revealed that teachers can be influenced by a number of construct-irrelevant factors as they work towards their judgements, factors such as gender, socio-economic background, effort and behaviour, that risk biasing their assessments. And when considering construct-relevant achievement evidence teachers are often expected to use verbal or semi-verbal sets of criteria, such as level descriptions, which typically require a degree of subjective interpretation in application and so are themselves a source of unwanted variation in judging standards. Arguably the most effective strategy for addressing these issues is participation in consensus moderation. Yet there have been few attempts to provide evidence of the effectiveness of moderation in practice. The potential value of, and the growing reliance upon, teacher assessment in high-stakes applications demand that evaluation of consensus moderation become a built-in part of the process.},

Collaborative teams are integral to research and allow more faculty members to contribute and benefit from professional academic development through scholarship. Collaborative team research should be investigated further to understand and promote cross-discipline and cultural collaboration potential for research and professional academic development possibilities with special attention given to opportunities for women, online, and adjunct faculty.},

This paper distinguishes between well-structured problems and ill-structured problems. Well-structured problems are constrained problems with convergent solutions that engage the application of a limited number of rules and principles within well-defined parameters. Ill-structured problems possess multiple solutions, solution paths, fewer parameters which are less manipulable, and contain uncertainty about which concepts, rules, and principles are necessary for the solution or how they are organized and which solution is best. For both types of problems, this paper presents models for how learners solve them and models for designing instruction to support problem-solving skill development. The model for solving well-structured problems is based on information processing theories of learning, while the model for solving ill-structured problems relies on an emerging theory of ill-structured problem solving and on constructivist and situated cognition approaches to learning.},

However it is also the story of a highly accessible public system since Canada boasts among the highest participation rates in the world, and has one of the most educated populations.

Details are provided outlining the assessment choices made by students and the impact on student satisfaction and the student success rates. Overall students demonstrated receptiveness towards the provision of assessment choice. This was evidenced by positive feedback from students, as well as improved subject satisfaction.

The authors reflect on a health professional student case study which illustrates how video enables students to powerfully demonstrate achievement against learning outcomes: they used filmic techniques to display empathy, patient centred collaboration and interprofessional communication. They also reflect on the barriers to video-based assessment raised by academics. Finally, they call upon leaders in higher education to recognise the utility of multi-media approaches to assessment of complex but critical graduate skills such as communication, digital literacy and interdisciplinarity, in addition to demonstrating the application of disciplinary knowledge to relevant and authentic problems.},

  abstract = {The lockdown imposed in India on 25 March 2020 resulted in the indefinite closure of education institutes all across the country. The government and educational institutes were quick to respond, they shifted teaching from offline to online mode. This article aims to identify the approaches made by the higher education institutions for continues imparting of education amidst lockdown. The article also identifies the challenges faced by teachers in online teaching from their homes. The study is descriptive and analytical in nature and data has been collected from secondary sources like reports, news articles, blogs, interview videos, magazines, social media, and journals to achieve the objective of the paper. Based on the secondary sources' information, the article also advocates the learning curve for the future to deal with any such crisis impact on the education system of India. The findings revealed that higher education institutions (HEIs) have taken many initiatives in this pandemic situation for imparting education. But these initiatives have not been very successful from the teacher's perspective. Teachers faced may issue in online teaching such as lack of technical facilities, family interruption, lack of training, lack of clarity \& direction, lack of technical knowledge. The learning curve of the article facilitates the HEIs to help them to execute the online educative in an effective manner.},

Consequently, a case study was conducted to carefully ascertain students' experiences during this transition. Fifteen undergraduates participated in this study. Informal structured interviews and semi-structured questionnaires were employed. Data were analyzed with the use of three major thematic headings: Online learning (ONL) is a possible instructional option, Face to Face learning (F2F) is essential for Mathematics and Face to Face learning (F2F) is necessary for human interaction. Recommendations for the use of more ONL education were offered.},

  abstract = {The present paper aims to detail the experience developed in a classroom of English Studies from the Spanish University of M{\'a}laga, where an alternative project-based learning methodology has been implemented. Such methodology is inspired by scrum sessions widely extended in technological companies where staff members work in teams and are assigned tasks within long-termed projects. Students were initially reluctant and afraid to work in teams but, as the experience advanced, their point of view was changing. Thus they positively stated that this methodology encouraged themselves to participate and to change ideas, with a deeper feeling of empathy, self-organisation and self-knowledge. At the end, most of the students declared they would participate again in a similar activity. Hence, considering the opinions from the students (and also from the teachers), and after observing the whole experience and analyzing the documents generated in an electronic portfolio, we think this method can be considered as a good proposal to accomplish a teaching-learning process of high quality at universities for three main reasons: first, it improves the capacity of using the knowledge in a disciplined, critical and creative way; second, it promotes the coexistence in heterogeneous human groups; and third, it develops the capacity of thinking, living and acting with complete autonomy.},

However, many critiques of MOOCs have indicated that low completion rates are a major concern. Using a latent class analysis (LCA), a more advanced methodology to identify latent subgroups, this study examined the heterogeneity of learners' behavioral patterns in a MOOC, categorized them into distinctive subgroups, and ultimately determined the optimal number of latent subgroups in a MOOC. The five subgroups identified in this study were: "completing" (6.6\%); "disengaging" (4.8\%); "auditing" (4.6\%); "sampling" (21.1\%); and "enrolling" (62.8\%). Results indicated this was the optimal number of subgroups. Given the characteristics of the three at-risk subgroups (disengaging, sampling, and enrolling), tailored instructional strategies and interventions to improve behavioral engagement are discussed.},

The activities were the nominal group technique, debate, invited expert, WebQuest and reflective deliberation. Quality of discussion was operationalised as cognitive presence, a construct developed to investigate the role of critical discourse in higher, distance education contexts. Using the quantitative content analysis technique, the postings of 19 students in an undergraduate university course were assigned to one of the four categories of cognitive presence. Across the five activities, the proportion and number of contributions categorised in the highest phases of cognitive presence was low (20.21\%), but was highest during the Webquest and debate activities. There are three advantageous qualities of these two activities, we argue: * 1They were well structured. * 2They provided clearly defined roles and responsibilities for the students. * 3They provoked the students to explicitly confront others' opinions.},

Likewise, in Turkey, it is still uncertain as to what will be taught, what instructional technologies will be employed, how infrastructural inequalities will be addressed, and how assessment and evaluation activities will be conducted. In this context, the purpose of this study was (a) to examine the experiences and opinions of academics, Distance Education Center managers, students, and parents and (b) offer solutions to emerging issues. In doing so, a qualitative research approach was employed, and the study was designed as a phenomenology. The data were collected from 175 individuals from 20 universities through Google Forms. The second cycle coding methods were employed in the analysis. The results indicated that COVID-19 had mostly psychological effects on individuals, and it affected every level of education at varying degrees. The pandemic reminded us how hopelessly we are dependent on traditional means of instruction by rendering us unable to use them. Since the beginning of the outbreak, many higher education institutions have been trying to implement distance education; however, the quality of instruction is rather questionable. This situation threatens the quality of learning outcomes and if not approached with due diligence, results could be catastrophic. Also, this mandatory transition to distance education has made the difference between the experienced and inexperienced academics more apparent. In light of the results, recommendations were provided for national and international policymakers. As long as the recommendations were implemented, all higher education stakeholders could attain the required knowledge and skills, and, in return, the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could be alleviated.},

This study presents perceptions and attitudes of students that attended a hybrid course in environmental engineering that suddenly converted to an online synchronous delivery due to COVID-19. It also presents an assessment of the hybrid and online synchronous delivery approach on the final exam scores as well as the final grades of the same course. The course, 'Introduction to Environmental Engineering', was developed as an online course for Civil and Environmental Engineering program students and delivered with hybrid and online synchronous options due to COVID-19 pandemic for several semesters to test the concept. In the hybrid delivery set up, all the quizzes and homework assignments were online while the midterm and final exams were in-class. For Spring 2020 the final exam was online and for Summer 2020 both the midterm and final exams were online due to COVID-19 adjustment. At the very end of the semesters, an online anonymous survey was conducted with five questions to understand the students' perception and attitude on exam taking options and learning environment. Students' perceptions and attitudes about online synchronous delivery approach compared to hybrid delivery approach, as well as the learning outcomes, appeared at face value not to be favorable. However, statistical analysis revealed that differences between online synchronous delivery and the Pre-COVID-19 hybrid delivery were not significant, indicating that, at least for these engineering students, online synchronous delivery is a justifiable option.},

Conventional standardized measures of mathematics achievement are not structured to directly assess this type of mathematical modeling. Therefore, a major question is whether a conventional standardized test can serve as a reliable "predictor" of students' potential to mathematical modeling performance. To investigate this question, a study was designed to find the relation between students' conventional standardized measures of mathematics achievement and their performance on mathematical modeling problems. Students' (N = 1656) SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) mathematics scores were used as a conventional standardized measure of achievement and students' scores on two model-creation problems based on complex settings were used to capture mathematical modeling performance to answer the question whether standardized achievement tests function well in predicting their mathematical modeling performance.},

In an effort to understand their role in successful and effective participation in online learning environments for language learning purposes, the study investigated their effect on 331 undergraduate L2 learners' self-reported assessments of their digital literacy skills and on the level of satisfaction they express with the online component of their English for Specific Purposes course in higher education in Greece. Data were gathered via four survey questionnaires that elicited relevant information on participants' digital literacy level, learner satisfaction, computer anxiety and self-efficacy respectively. Statistical analysis of the results revealed an overall adequate level of students' digital literacy skills and a high level of satisfaction with all aspects of the online module of the blended learning course. Females reported a lower level of CA and a higher level of CSE. CA was found to be the strongest predictor of learners' digital literacy skills assessments and CSE of learner satisfaction perceptions, resulting in overall higher IT use and positive attitudes to the course.},

Gamification has been shown across multiple levels of academic instruction to have a positive impact on task completion by augmenting the experiential elements encountered by students who are engaging in the learning process. When a task becomes mundane, it typically lacks a positive feedback loop, which results in it becoming easier for a person to put off their intended task and forget to return to the activity prior to deadline. Many online learners participate in their degree programs in the midst of highly involved personal schedules, which can lead to lapses in organization and reduced performance as a student. Many applications have promise for improving the levels of fun, engagement, motivation, and task completion in various areas of daily life. Online faculty, can integrate these applications with existing online curricula to help students bridge the gap between passive stagnation in a course and active engagement with the course material to increase their grades earned and course-wide satisfaction.},

Drawing on servant leadership and social learning theories, we examine how the servant leadership of managers in support roles can initiate a social learning process that shapes the leadership style of line managers and thereby influences employee outcomes throughout the organization. To facilitate the integration between servant leadership and social learning theories, we also examine the role of efficacy beliefs in enhancing the effectiveness of the social learning process. Using nested, time-lagged data from 667 store managers, 121 line managers, and 23 human resource managers (i.e., support managers), we find that support managers' servant leadership positively influences organizational members' perceptions of overall justice and leader-member exchange through line manager servant leadership. In turn, employees' favorable perceptions stemming from line manager servant leadership enhance the employees' organizational commitment and job satisfaction. The results also indicate that high leadership self-efficacy augments line managers' effectiveness in emulating servant leadership behaviors from support managers and reinforces the indirect effects on organizational members' favorable perceptions.},

The framework is informed by key principles and approaches underpinning effective formative assessment and, more specifically, by approaches to formative assessment that leverage the functionalities of technology. The overall aim is to provide a structured conceptualisation of digital formative assessment that supports the planning of lectures and other teaching and learning activities in higher education classrooms. At the heart of the framework, as presented in this paper, is a 12-cell grid comprising 4 key formative assessment strategies (sharing learning intentions and success criteria, questioning and discussion, feedback, and peer- and self-assessment) crossed with 3 functionalities of technology (sending and displaying, processing and analysing, and interactive environments). These functionalities of technologies are used as the basis to integrate digital tools into formative assessment for effective teaching and learning processes. For each cell in the grid, an exemplary digital formative assessment practice is described. This paper highlights the framework's potential for enhancing the practice of digital formative assessment and its significance in light of the ongoing digital transformation. This paper concludes with suggesting a programme of research that might be undertaken to evaluate its utility and impact in higher education contexts.},

Additionally, learning data is often inaccessible to teachers or served in a manner that fails to support or inform their teaching and design practice. We need systematic, learner-centred ways for teachers to design learning data that supports them. Drawing on decades of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) research, we show how to make use of important AIED concepts: (1) learner models; (2) Open Learner Models (OLMs); (3) scrutability and (4) Ontologies. We show how these concepts can be used in the design of OLMs, interfaces that enable a learner to see and interact with an externalised representation of their learning progress. We extend this important work by demonstrating how OLMs can also drive a learner-centred design process of learning data. We draw on the work of Biggs on constructive alignment (Biggs, 1996, 1999, 2011), which has been so influential in education. Like Biggs, we propose a way for teachers to design the learning data in their subjects and we illustrate the approach with case studies. We show how teachers can use this approach today, essentially integrating the design of learning data along with the learning design for their subjects. We outline a research agenda for designing the collection of richer learning data. There are three core contributions of this paper. First, we present the terms OLM, learner model, scrutability and ontologies, as thinking tools for systematic design of learning data. Second, we show how to integrate this into the design and refinement of a subject. Finally, we present a research agenda for making this process both easier and more powerful.},

We divide these into off-line evidence (which can be collected in studies devised and implemented after or before the assessment task has been administered) and online evidence (which is gathered directly from test-takers or research participants while they are completing assessment tasks). Finally, we describe an instance where we combined multiple forms of evidence in the development phases of a large-scale testing program, in order to illustrate how different evidence types can be collected and combined during assessment development and analyzed for insights into student cognition.},

Interactivity in learning communities' online discourse is viewed in this study as a socio-constructivist process. It is the network of interactions among content items and participants which drives a collective knowledge construction process. Conceptualizing interactivity in the literature is still unclear and not enough is known about its role in knowledge construction and about its relationship to learning outcomes. In addition, assessing learning outcomes using analytics has not matured fully and is still subject to intense development. This study thus sets out to investigate the role of interactivity as a process of knowledge construction within online discussions, and in particular, its association with learning outcomes, as measured by formal assessment tasks. We present significant positive correlations between various interactivity measures, taken from various learning communities, and a set of well-known learning assessments. We suggest that patterns of interactivity among learners can be measured, and teach us, not just about group dynamics and collaboration, but also about the actual individual learning process.

This process transforms low-level log data into a set of action set labels that can be utilized in a number of different measurement models so that proficiency can be assessed solely from in-task behavioral data.},

However, there seems to be no shared understanding of how the assessment of instructional labs should be arranged to best serve students' learning and development of expertise. This literature review intends to fill this gap by reviewing the research on classroom assessment of instructional labs from the perspectives of different objectives, purposes, and agents of assessment. The review reveals that classroom assessment in instructional labs has mostly focused on summative assessment, leaving the possibilities of formative assessment understudied. Further, assessment has been conducted mostly by teachers and teaching assistants, and the possibilities for students' participation in assessment remain unutilized. Two major gaps in the research on instructional labs were identified. The first gap concerns students' active participation in assessment. Given the active role that students have in the laboratory, their agency in assessment appears to be narrow. The second gap concerns the inclusion of metaskills and perspectives on lifelong learning and work life in assessment. We summarize our findings into a research-based model that assists in the consideration and balancing of different objectives, purposes, and agents in the design of classroom assessment of instructional labs.},

Data collected included classroom observations, instructor interviews, course artifacts, and student focus groups. Qualitative data analysis revealed that each instructor's core personal practical assessment theories affected implementation of formative assessment. Tasha's core assessment theories led her to believe that assessment should be a carefully planned motivational and learning opportunity for students. Meanwhile, Jack viewed assessment as a diverse and stress-free student learning experiment. Cross-case analysis revealed that the teachers' reasoning and decision-making differences were based on the interaction of their personal practical assessment theories and contextual elements. Overall, this study provides insights into the practice of formative assessment in higher education and identifies some challenges and opportunities such assessment presents.},

  abstract = {Concept map (CM) is introduced as a useful tool for studying students' system thinking (ST). However, it is more known to represent students' knowledge of system components and organization and less recognized as a tool to examine and enhance students' understanding about the underlying causal mechanisms in complex systems. In this study, through a mixed method approach, we investigated the potential of CM in demonstrating undergraduate students' (n\,=\,173) ST. We also conducted a comparative analysis to examine the effects of different scaffolding on developing students' ST skills. Through a theoretical framework of causal patterns, we present a new perspective on what CM reveals about students' ST and what are its limitations in showing system complexities. The results indicated that CM can provide a platform for students to practice causal mechanisms such as domino, mutual, relational, and cyclic causalities, and accordingly, work as a tool for teachers to examine students' knowledge of such mechanisms. The results also showed that students improved in demonstrating ST by CM when they were scaffolded for showing causal mechanisms and building CM. Eventually, this study concludes that the CM is a highly relevant tool to increase and examine students' ST skills. To this end, we found it is important to explicitly teach students about causal patterns and guide them to construct CM with an emphasis on showing the interconnection among concepts.},

  abstract = {Background Dental education involves teaching and assessing the acquisition of verifiable domains that require superior psychomotor, communication, and cognitive skills. Evolving technologies and methods of assessment could enhance student learning environment and improve tutor assessment experience. Objective The aim of this study was to introduce the application of a comprehensive high-stakes online exam to final-year dental students during the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluate its effectiveness. Design A high-stakes exam was introduced and implemented online to the final-year dental students prior to their graduation. The exam consisted of four components: MEQs, MCQs, OSCE and an oral exam. The exam and invigilation were conducted using Blackboard and MS Teams programs. Stakeholders' views of the exam were obtained using two tailored surveys, one for students and another for faculty; both included closed- and open-ended questions. Results The exam was run successfully without untoward events. Both students and staff were satisfied with the online exam with the latter being more satisfied than the former. Students with previous experience in online learning system were more satisfied with the online exam compared with those with less experience (p{$<$} 0.05). The main issues raised by students' satisfaction with the exam were: inadequacy of time for the MEQ part, prevention of back tracking in the MCQ part and minor technological issues, whereas those raised by faculty members were increased time required to complete the exam setup and grading compared to the paper-based exam and minor technological issues. Conclusions A newly introduced, multi-format, online high-stakes exam was implemented successfully to final-year dental students with minor technological issues and good satisfaction by students and staff alike.},

  abstract = {Assessments help in evaluating the knowledge gained by a learner at any specific point as well as in continuous improvement of the curriculum design and the whole learning process. However, with the increase in students' enrollment at University level in either conventional or distance education environment, traditional ways of assessing students' work are becoming insufficient in terms of both time and effort. In distance education environment, such assessments become additionally more challenging in terms of hefty remuneration for hiring large number of tutors. The availability of automated tools to assist the evaluation of students' work and providing students with appropriate and timely feedback can really help in overcoming these problems. We believe that building such tools for assessing students' work for all kinds of courses in not yet possible. However, courses that involve some formal language of expression can be automated, such as, programming courses in Computer Science (CS) discipline. Instructors provide various practical exercises to students as assignments to build these skills. Usually, instructors manually grade and provide feedbacks on these assignments. Although in literature, various tools have been reported to automate this process, but most of these tools have been developed by the host institutions themselves for their own use. We at COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Lahore are conducting a pioneer effort in Pakistan to automate the marking of assignments of introductory programming courses that involve C or C++ languages with the capability of associating appropriate feedbacks for students. In this paper, we basically identify different components that we believe are necessary in building an effective automated assessment system in the context of introductory programming courses that involve C/C++ programming.},

  abstract = {Online examinations, commonly referred to as e-exams (electronic examinations), underwent a considerable progression, getting adapted ubiquitously among higher education institutions worldwide. Their preferment was rapid due to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The process of conducting exams online is being opted as the appropriate way of assessment, ensuring the students' safety and well-being. According to Warts et al., this form of examination has been pretty effective in the past when blended with the conventional assessment. However, at present, implemented as the singular way of assessment, e-exams have shown a more significant promise in being beneficial to the learners. As a matter of fact, a comprehensive analysis on understanding the learners' perception towards the e-exams was not done earlier, particularly in the developing nations. Thus, it was pertinent to examine the pre-requisites of e-exams to promote it as a useful tool for the smooth conduct of exams in the aforesaid nations. Against such a backdrop, this study was conducted during January to March 2021 on 207 students enrolled in four universities, three situated in the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, India: Delhi University (DU), Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI), and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), and one situated in Saudi Arabia, namely Saudi Electronic University (SEU). A quantitative approach was employed for the study, with the responses recorded via web questionnaires. Confirmatory -factor analysis (CFA) was applied in the study to examine whether the process of conducting online examinations is being chosen as the appropriate form of assessment, ensuring the safety and well-being of students through AMOS (version 24) software. For determining the reliability of the two latent constructs, namely "Perceptions of students towards E-exams (PSE)" and "Pre-requisites of E-exams (POE)," Cronbach's alpha was used through SPSS (version 25) software in the study, and the results reveal that the strong internal consistency exists between all the measured variables. In addition, the mean and standard deviation were used by the researchers to find out the pre-requisites of the online examination system. The participants expressed their insights on the relative benefits of online examination. Their perception was based on pedagogy, validity and reliability, affective factors, practicality, and security. From their insights, it was concluded that online examination is more advantageous than conventional paper-based exams. The outcome also applies to the authenticity of grading and the overall efficiency concerning the time, effort, and expenditure on conducting the examination. Contrarily, the participating students also recognized numerous hurdles in implementing e-exams concerning security, validity, and impartiality. The conclusion further revealed that online examination is especially relevant for formative assessment of learning instead of summative assessment, provided authenticity, security, and flexibility are used as fundamental tenants in the proper implementation of e-exams. The outcome of the present study will facilitate higher education institutions and policymakers in taking the electronic examination system to the next level.},

This study investigated the perceptions of teachers and students of public universities, and examined their views of online pedagogy, assessment and the major challenges faced. Data were collected from 158 teachers and 1468 students through survey questionnaires and Focus Group Discussions. Results indicate that participants had favourable attitudes towards online classes, but they expressed concern for students who they thought were marginalized due to lack of digital devices and poor internet connectivity. Inadequate teacher preparation, lack of familiarity with online pedagogy, limited know-how of online assessment and issues of affordability and equity were reported to be the major threats. Initial insights highlight the need for supporting the disadvantaged students as well as training teachers to employ appropriate tools and techniques for teaching and assessing online.},

A mixed-method research approach was used to collect data. The quantitative data were collected using a survey questionnaire and focus group discussion method was used to gather qualitative data. The students' views of their instructors' online instructional and assessment strategies revealed that teachers confined themselves to the university guidelines and used the recommended learning management system (LMS) and digital tools but lacked the training to utilise many of the features available in the recommended LMS and digital tools that could be integrated with the LMS due to poor knowledge and ICT skills. This study suggests that HEIs should invest in research to understand students' choices of digital tools and train teachers to maximise the use of the LMS.},

One of the emerging methods for increasing trust in AI systems is to use eXplainable AI (XAI), which promotes the use of methods that produce transparent explanations and reasons for decisions AI systems make. Considering the existing literature on XAI, this paper argues that XAI in education has commonalities with the broader use of AI but also has distinctive needs. Accordingly, we first present a framework, referred to as XAI-ED, that considers six key aspects in relation to explainability for studying, designing and developing educational AI tools. These key aspects focus on the stakeholders, benefits, approaches for presenting explanations, widely used classes of AI models, human-centred designs of the AI interfaces and potential pitfalls of providing explanations within education. We then present four comprehensive case studies that illustrate the application of XAI-ED in four different educational AI tools. The paper concludes by discussing opportunities, challenges and future research needs for the effective incorporation of XAI in education.},

In this changing landscape, ensuring consistency among the assessments for different offerings of a course (within or across terms), providing meaningful feedback about student achievements, and tracking student progress over time are all challenging tasks, particularly at scale. Here, a collection of visual Topic Dependency Models (TDMs) is proposed to help address these challenges. It uses statistical models to determine and visualize student achievements on one or more topics and their dependencies at a course level reference TDM (e.g., CS 100) as well as assessment data at the classroom level (e.g., students in CS 100 Term 1 2016 Section 001), both at one point in time (static) and over time (dynamic). The collection of TDMs share a common two-weighted graph foundation. Exemplar algorithms are presented for the creation of the course reference and selected class (static and dynamic) TDMs; the algorithms are illustrated using a common symbolic example. Studies on the application of the TDM collection on datasets from two university courses are presented; these case studies utilize the open-source, proof of concept tool under development.},

The data was analyzed using IBM SPSS AMOS version 21.0 via confirmatory factor analysis for its validity, and internal consistency values via Cronbach alpha values for its reliability. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated acceptable fit indices regarding validity, and Cronbach alpha values indicated a high level reliability.

The present study employed a mixed-method design using pre-post writing tasks and pre-post questionnaires to investigate what particularly beneficial affordances this type of media-rich feedback might offer for writers in the English-Medium Instruction (EMI) classroom, to identify the effects of AVF on changes in learners' motivation, and to explore students' perceptions towards screencast feedback. The results suggest that AVF is positively received by EFL learners and that simultaneous visual cues and detailed explanations promote better understanding, engagement, and active listening. In addition, AVF significantly improves learners' writing performance and academic motivation. The paper concludes with practical implications and suggestions for further research.},

Direct observation represents a fundamental skill for professionals involved in behavior change. The present study evaluated the effectiveness of an automated simulation in teaching graduate and undergraduate students (N = 31) to collect partial-interval recording data pertaining to inappropriate behavior. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control condition or intervention condition consisting of a brief simulated observation of a student exhibiting problem behavior. Results suggest participants who used VR were more confident in their ability to collect data; however, evidence for improved outcomes related to data collection was not identified.

From the perspective of the Indian student, however, the problem is often cast in more human terms, with an emphasis on the need for a higher educational system that respects them for who they are, that is relevant to their view of the world, that offers reciprocity in their relationships with others, and that helps them exercise responsibility over their own lives. This paper examines the implications of these differences in perspective and identifies ways in which initiatives within and outside of existing institutions are transforming the landscape of higher education for First Nations/American Indian people in both Canada and the United States.},

Are claims about technology transforming learning and teaching in higher education borne out by actual practices? This paper draws upon a critical analysis of recent research literature concerning Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL). It argues that few published accounts of TEL practices show evidence of a scholarly approach to university teaching. Frequently, TEL interventions appear to be technology-led rather than responding to identified teaching and learning issues. The crucial role of teachers' differing conceptions of teaching and of the purpose of professional development activities is often ignored. We argue that developing a more scholarly approach among university teachers is more essential than providing technical training if practices are to be improved to maximise the effectiveness of TEL.},

Using a theory-based CSCL framework, two studies evaluated whether two tools, Radar and Reflector, supported cognitive, social and socio-emotional aspects of team development, encouraging promotive interaction and group processing in the teams. While not affecting product quality, tool use did lead to groups who perceived their team as being better developed, as having higher levels of group satisfaction and lower levels of conflicts.

In reviewing the literature, it was determined that there is no clear and unequivocal picture of how, when, and why the effectiveness of these two approaches to learning differ, a result which may be due to differing complexities of the learning tasks used in the research and the concomitant load imposed on the learner{\quotesinglbase}{\"A}{\^o}s cognitive system. Based upon cognitive load theory, it is argued that learning by an individual becomes less effective and efficient than learning by a group of individuals as task complexity increases. Dividing the processing of information across individuals is useful when the cognitive load is high because it allows information to be divided across a larger reservoir of cognitive capacity. Although such division requires that information be recombined and that processing be coordinated, under high load conditions, these costs are minimal compared to the gain achieved by this division of labor. In contrast, under low load conditions, an individual can adequately carry out the required processing activities, and the costs of recombination and coordination are relatively more substantial. Implications of these ideas for research and practice of collaborative learning are discussed.},

This paper uses experiential methodology to draw upon my experience in practice, and systematic literature review methodology to draw upon supporting scholarly literature by leaders in the field, to contribute to existing knowledge on the meaning of each of these concepts, and more importantly to distinguish between them in a study of Research Methods, and in particular as they relate to designing a research proposal and a thesis for a higher degree. The primary aim is to help the reader develop a firm grasp of the meaning of these concepts and how they should be used in academic research discourses. The review answers five questions. 1. What does each of these terms mean? 2. When and how should each be used? 3. What purposes does a theoretical framework serve? 4. How do you develop a theoretical framework for your research proposal or thesis? 5. What does a good theoretical framework look like?},

Several behavioral science interventions have shown promise in raising student persistence and completion rates in a handful of courses, but evidence of their effectiveness across diverse educational contexts is limited. In this study, we test a set of established interventions over 2.5 y, with one-quarter million students, from nearly every country, across 247 online courses offered by Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Stanford. We hypothesized that the interventions would produce medium-to-large effects as in prior studies, but this is not supported by our results. Instead, using an iterative scientific process of cyclically preregistering new hypotheses in between waves of data collection, we identified individual, contextual, and temporal conditions under which the interventions benefit students. Self-regulation interventions raised student engagement in the first few weeks but not final completion rates. Value-relevance interventions raised completion rates in developing countries to close the global achievement gap, but only in courses with a global gap. We found minimal evidence that state-of-the-art machine learning methods can forecast the occurrence of a global gap or learn effective individualized intervention policies. Scaling behavioral science interventions across various online learning contexts can reduce their average effectiveness by an order-of-magnitude. However, iterative scientific investigations can uncover what works where for whom.},

While successful distance teaching requires careful thinking, planning, and the development of technological and human resources, there was no time for preparation in the current situation. Various physics courses, including lectures, tutorials, and laboratory courses, had to be transferred to online formats, resulting in a variety of simultaneous, asynchronous, and mixed activities. To investigate how physics students perceived the sudden shift to online learning, we developed a questionnaire and gathered data from N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 578 physics students from five universities in Germany, Austria, and Croatia. In this article, we report how the problem-solving sessions (recitations) and laboratories were adapted, how students judge the different formats of the courses, and how useful and effective they perceived them. The results are correlated with the students' self-efficacy ratings and other behavioral measures (such as self-regulated learning skills). This study is descriptive in nature, and a survey study design was implemented to examine the relationships among the variables. We found that good communication abilities (r {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.48, p{$<$}0.001) and self-organization skills (r {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.63, p{$<$}0.001) are positively correlated with perceived learning achievement. Furthermore, the previous duration of studies had a significant impact on several self-reported achievement measures, resulting in consistently lower scores of students in their first academic year compared with students who were further along academically. We draw conclusions and suggest implications for future online classes on the instructor and faculty level. Suggestions include (i) focusing on first-year courses with on-campus teaching when facing limited lecture hall capacities, (ii) offering special courses for promoting self-regulated learning skills, (iii) emphasizing the positive aspects of distance learning, and (iv) installing networking services for supporting student communication.},

There has, however, been debate on what should be assessed and how the assessment should be implemented. The most common form of assessment involves grading the individual discussion contributions, but it has been suggested that employing a culminating task based on the AOD may be effective. This preliminary study compared the effect on student critical thinking of two approaches to AOD assessment: using a post-AOD assessment, and assessing the discussion contributions themselves. The results, though tentative, showed that while both assessment approaches resulted in significant improvements in student critical thinking, there was no difference in the impact on critical thinking skills between using the post-AOD assessment and assessing the discussion contributions. This result suggests that the form of assessment used in an AOD may be less important than the fact that assessment is included. Interviews with students also provided some insight into ways in which they perceived the discussion environment had contributed to their critical thinking skills. The findings of this study pave the way for further research in this important area. [Author abstract]},

With increasing student numbers, it is not feasible to have staff-student ratios and round-the-clock availability required to provide instant feedback and ever-more interactive teaching sessions, so digital solutions are the only option. There is already growing comfort with using computers in formal assessment; however, more work is required to extend beyond performance indicators enabling digital assessments, to addressing how students apply their learning to relevant work-based scenarios. This opinion piece discusses the issues HE currently face to ensure students develop the employability skills that equip them to be proficient in the skills directly related to their degree subject but also transferable to other graduate careers. It raises possible solutions to current technological problems in developing more computer-based assessment, to enable academics to design assessments that develop the capabilities students need.},

Four meta-analyses were conducted, with two each exploring the impact of (a) grades versus no performance feedback and (b) grades versus comments on academic motivation and achievement, respectively. Overall results indicated that grades positively influenced achievement but negatively influenced motivation compared to no feedback. However, compared to those who received comments, students receiving grades had poorer achievement and less optimal motivation. Moderator analyses generally suggested that overall effects varied as a function of the type of motivation (i.e. the specific construct, internal vs. external motivation), context (e.g. academic subject; comment type), student characteristics (e.g. achievement level), and methodology (i.e. grade anticipation versus receipt), though it was not possible to test these moderators in all analyses. Theoretical and methodological contributions and implications for education practice are discussed.},

Lecturers' learning access equity strategies made learning resources available asynchronously, but having access did not imply that students could effectively self-direct learning. Lecturers designed classroom replication, online practical skills training, online assessment integrity, and student engagement strategies to boost online learning quality, but students who used ineffective online participation strategies had poor engagement. These findings indicate that lecturers and students need to develop more dexterity for adapting and manoeuvring their online strategies across different online teaching and learning modalities.

ODL e-Assessment systems have evolved from Computer Assisted / Aided Assessment (CAA) systems through intelligent assessment and feedback systems. E-Assessment (electronic assessment) connotes using electronic technology and tools to design and administer assessments, collect and store students' assessment evidences, grade performance, provide feedback and generate reports. The widely recognized advantages of e-Assessment over traditional, paper-based assessment include: lower long term costs, instant feedback to students, greater flexibility with respect to location and timing, improved reliability with machine marking, improved impartiality, and enhanced question styles that incorporate interactivity and multimedia. The advent of Learning Management Systems (LMS), such as Moodle (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment) paved the way for integrated advanced services for: interactive dialogue, controlling knowledge at different stages of distance process and e-Assessment systems. Moodle provides the complete integrated environment for handling all aspects of e-Assessment from authoring questions through to reports for course teams (Butcher, 2008). This study explores how Moodle functionality: supports diagnostic, formative, summative and competency-based assessments and facilitates ODL institutions design, administer and manage e-Assessments.},

Subgroup analyses were performed for methodological, study, and sample characteristics. Data sources were obtained from systematic search of key terms using Ovid Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, APA PsycINFO, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, and ProQuest dissertations and theses through May 28, 2021. Eligible studies were those that (1) assessed concussion or mild traumatic brain injury; (2) included symptoms or days to recovery for {$\geq$}2 time points; (3) included 2 groups with 1 group assigned to rest; and (4) were written in the English language.Results:In total, 19 studies involving 4239 participants met criteria. Prescribed rest had a significant negative effect on symptoms (k = 15; g = ?0.27; SE = 0.11; 95\% CI, ?0.48 to ?0.05; P = .04) but not on recovery time (k = 8; g = ?0.16; SE = 0.21; 95\% CI, ?0.57 to 0.26; P = .03). Subgroup analyses suggested that studies with shorter duration ({$<$}28 days) (g = ?0.46; k = 5), studies involving youth (g = ?0.33; k = 12), and studies focused on sport-related concussion (g = ?0.38; k = 8) reported higher effect sizes.Conclusion:The findings support a small negative effect for prescribed rest on symptoms after concussion. Younger age and sport-related mechanisms of injury were associated with a greater negative effect size. However, the lack of support for an effect for recovery time and the relatively small overall numbers of eligible studies highlight ongoing concerns regarding the quantity and rigor of clinical trials in concussion.Registration:CRD42021253060 (PROSPERO).}

  abstract = {Background Authentic assessment and two-stage exams have recently received attention; however, they are rarely used together. We reimagine assessment by integrating an authentic, computer-based assessment into the structure of a two-stage exam in a large engineering class. Purpose We seek to identify ways that such assessment extends classroom testing to better align with engineering practice by examining the ways teams negotiate uncertainty to make engineering decisions. We also identify differing students' reactions to increased uncertainty during tests. Design/Method Using the methodical framework of design-based research, we analyze performance and reflection data for 117 student teams through two design iterations to explore four design and theoretical conjectures. Results Teams chose multiple solution paths to this authentic task, an aspect that aligns with the characteristics of engineering practice that we seek to assess. In addition, the technology tool allows the evaluation of procedural accuracy for many of the teams' chosen paths. The teams' decision-making performances correlate; however, decision-making and traditional assessments do not correlate, suggesting they measure different competencies. The computer-based second stage provides a holistic assessment that shifts the messages that students implicitly receive about valued practices in the classroom. However, not all students took up the authentic group assessment in desired ways. Conclusions Technology-based two-stage exams with authentic assessment show promise to shift testing practices in large engineering classes to include decision-making. Such assessments better align with engineering practices that are valued in the profession, but more work is needed to develop systems for widespread implementation.},

  abstract = {Context: The context of this study is vocational teacher education and the participants are vocational student teachers studying part-time in a blended learning setting. They represent several disciplines of vocational education and training. The vocational teacher studies take one year and are 60 credits. The study relates to the discussion of vocational education and training and teachers' competencies which they are transferring to their students by sharing their knowledge of their subject area and working practices. This study is an exploration of one of these working practices making competences visible in a digital format. Approach: Student teachers' descriptions of their practices and recommendations of supportive methods for composing an ePortfolio are reviewed and their motivation to compose an ePortfolio is studied as a part of the Personal Learning Environment (PLE) philosophy. Findings: The data revealed some typical practices, such as creating an ePortfolio (the most popular ways of doing this were recording reflections in a learning diary and using digital tools to document artefacts) and demonstrating vocational teachers' competence in an ePortfolio (understanding the difference between workspace and showcase portfolios and what kinds of competences to document). The recommendations mentioned by participants were supportive methods of composing an ePortfolio (collaborative learning processes with peers, lecturers' feedback and assessment and clear instructions) as well as methods of displaying vocational teachers' competence (e.g. orientation to ePortfolio work using learning objectives and assessment criteria for ePortfolios). Participating student teachers were motivated to work with ePortfolios in various ways and expressed an intrinsic motivation to pursue personal growth and become a vocational teacher. Conclusions: The study revealed vocational student teachers' perceptions of scaffolding and motivational orientations to make their competences visible through ePortfolios. These can be used to design scaffolding methods to support students' ePortfolio activities. ePortfolios are used as a study method to promote student teachers' career development and personal growth and to help them acquire teacher competencies.},

  abstract = {High stakes mid-course and final exams have long been a dominant assessment model. But exam performance does not necessarily correlate with learning or students' ability to apply learning to real-life scenarios outside the classroom. Reliance on such high-stakes assessments can result in elevated learner stress during exam times and lack of learner engagement during non-exam times. Active learning requires ongoing student engagement, and assessments of student work completed in such activities are authentic archetypes of student learning that demonstrate student ability to apply their learning to authentic situations, problems, and issues. This article argues that assessment practices based on multiple, low-stakes, iterative assessments within an active learning environment provide more targeted feedback and engage students in their own learning as active participants, which leads to increased student success. The case study presented in this article is specific to foreign-language courses offered through online education. Combining best practices of learner engagement in the online environment and assessment in the communicative language classroom, language faculty in an open enrollment program developed an assessment model for asynchronous, introductory language courses that relies on multiple low-stakes assessments that culminate in a final, summative portfolio project. This article will offer examples of how the portfolio project is situated in the course and an overview of portfolio project topics. Example instructions and assessment rubrics will be provided. Data from the first full year of implementation will be analyzed to begin to assess the impact and effectiveness of this portfolio assessment.},

Consequently, the need for workable criteria for optimal media deployment has been underestimated. A framework is proposed to help course developers design such media selection procedures. This has two ingredients: a broad categorisation of comparative merits of different media and a finer-grained inventory of media-distinctive techniques and teaching functions. Five media are considered in depth: radio and TV (broadcast), audio and video (cassette, with complementary notes) and print. These are then compared briefly with computer-based media. The analysis considers six types of media characteristics: symbol system, access, controllability, student reactivity, interactivity, adaptivity. The framework was developed collaboratively over several years, with the help of theorists and practitioners in international seminars and workshops.},

This essay traces the initial forays into teaching online classes by three Faculty of Education professors at one small Canadian university and an instructional designer / teacher who joined part-way through the research journey. Included are our understandings of how our teaching practices evolved amidst initial uncertainties and expanding abilities, our renewed awareness of the importance of collegial support and encouragement, and the implications for future online teaching experiences. Our essay provides an intimate window into our online teaching journeys and captures specific moments we experienced at various stages in the development of our e-instructional practices. The account of our processes of becoming online teacher educators is supported by an interweaving of historical and current literature on pedagogy and e-learning, and serves to address the dearth of research into the processes educators undergo when engaged in online teaching.},

Challenges were most acute for highly interactive classes that were forced to move to asynchronous online learning environments. In response to these challenges, we developed an instructional model, rooted in group communication theories and concepts, designed to promote meaningful online learner-to-learner interaction. We provide an analytical assessment of our communication-based "Learning Pod" model, which was implemented in five English classes taught in the Department of English and American Studies at a German university during the COVID-19 shutdown. In Part 1 we describe the model, its development, and its implementation. In Part 2 we analyze learners' perceptions of the model's effectiveness using a mixed-methods approach. Results demonstrate the viability of the model, indicating that it is possible to provide meaningful interaction in asynchronous online classes, even in the midst of a pandemic, if communication goals are clearly articulated and strategically implemented.},

The aim of the redevelopment was to steer the initiative towards a more integrative and sustainable implementation, as manifest in the applied construct of an online partnership learning community. Our evolving experience of the e-helpdesk highlighted the central role of the facilitator in engineering and maintaining social presence in the online community. We propose an extended model for building an online partnership learning community, whereby partnership encapsulates all the essential elements of student and staff partnership as outlined in the HEA framework, but is also critically defined by similar parameters of partnership between users and facilitators. In this model, the facilitator's role becomes more involved in instructional teaching as disciplinary expertise increases, but descending levels of disciplinary expertise can foster ascending levels of independent learning and shared discovery for both users and facilitators.},

Therefore, the present study was an explorative descriptive study that used the qualitative approach to attain the research aim. This study used a questionnaire, students' reflections, and interview in collecting student's perceptions toward the interventions. The results suggest that the technology-enhanced pre-instructional peer assessment helps students to prepare the new content acquisition and become a source of students' motivation in improving their learning performance for the following main body of the lesson. A set of practical suggestions is also proposed for designing and implementing technology-enhanced pre-instructional peer assessment.},

To deal with the situation, educators seek an alternative learning design to be implemented and it is expected to have either comparable or improved learning outcome. This study describes Online Learning (OL) design which assesses speaking performance in ESP classes. The participants of the study were students year 2019 (N=118) and students year 2020 (N=96) joining English for Electrical Engineering (EEE) which has the same syllabus and learning goal. A proposed Gagne's Nine Events of Instruction is analyzed, planned, implemented, and assessed its effectiveness of speaking activities which were done in the former-year-class (using F2F method) then applied in current class (using OL method). The result of F2F and Online Learning (OL) outcome were compared. To complete the analysis, a sequence of questionnaire was given to the students. The results indicates that using Gagne's Nine Events of Instruction, speaking activity in online learning classroom, achieved satisfactory result. Designing OL both synchronous and asynchronous method for speaking is as effective as F2F. This study may open another research prospect on barriers in OL, how to assess speaking performance via online platform, or others.},

Using South Africa as a case study, it argues that US multinationals exercise imperial control at the architecture level of the digital ecosystem: software, hardware and network connectivity, which then gives rise to related forms of domination. The monopoly power of multinational corporations is used for resource extraction through rent and surveillance ? economic domination. By controlling the digital ecosystem, Big Tech corporations control computer-mediated experiences, giving them direct power over political, economic and cultural domains of life ? imperial control. The centrepiece of surveillance capitalism, Big Data, violates the sanctity of privacy and concentrates economic power in the hands of US corporations ? a system of global surveillance capitalism. As a feature of surveillance capitalism, Global North intelligence agencies partner with their own corporations to conduct mass and targeted surveillance in the Global South ? which intensifies imperial state surveillance. US elites have persuaded people that society must proceed according to its ruling class conceptions of the digital world, setting the foundation for tech hegemony. The author argues for a different ecosystem that decentralises technology by placing control directly into the hands of the people to counter the rapidly advancing frontier of digital empire.}

Next, I document the role such variables play in test-taking motivation, item-position effects, test anxiety, and responses to formative feedback. Finally, I briefly review measurement approaches, pointing out some improvements to the commonly used self-assessment scale, including forced-choice and anchoring vignettes as well as performance measures such as situational judgment tests and collaborative problem-solving measures.},

Similar to faculty educators, learning designers in higher education play a vital role in maintaining students' privacy by designing learning experiences that rely on online technology integration. Like other professional designers, they need to care for the humans they design for by not producing designs that infringe on their privacy, thus, not causing harm. Recognizing that widely used instructional design models are silent on the topic and do not address ethical considerations such as privacy, we focus this paper on how design ethics can be leveraged by learning designers in higher education in a practical manner, illustrated through authentic examples. We highlight where the ethical responsibility of learning designers comes into the foreground when maintaining students' privacy and well-being, especially in online settings. We outline an existing ethical decision-making framework and show how learning designers can use it as a call to action to protect the students they design for, strengthening their ethical design capacity.

Design ethics within learning design is often discussed in abstract ways with principles that are difficult to apply.                                                                       Most, if not all, design models that learning design professionals have learned are either silent on design ethics and/or do not consider ethics as a valid dimension, thus, making design ethics mostly excluded from learning design graduate programs.                                                                       Practical means for engaging in ethical design practice are scarce in the field.                                                                                                       What this paper adds                                                                     A call for learning designers in higher education to maintain and protect students' privacy and well-being, strengthening their ethical design capacity.                                                                       A demonstration of how to use a practical ethical decision-making framework as a designerly tool in designing for learning to maintain and protect students' privacy and well-being.                                                                       Authentic examples---in the form of vignettes---of ethical dilemmas/issues that learning designers in higher education could face, focused on students' privacy.                                                                       Methods---using a practical ethical decision-making framework---for learning design professionals in higher education, grounded in the philosophy of designers as the guarantors of designs, to be employed to detect situations where students' privacy and best interests are at risk.                                                                       A demonstration of how learning designers could make stellar design decisions in service to the students they design for and not to the priorities of other design stakeholders.                                                                                                       Implications for practice and/or policy                                                                     Higher education programs/institutions that prepare/employ learning designers ought to treat the topics of the designer's responsibility and design ethics more explicitly and practically as one of the means to maintain and protect students' privacy, in addition to law and policies.                                                                       Learning designers in higher education ought to hold a powerful position in their professional practice to maintain and protect students' privacy and well-being, as an important aspect of their ethical design responsibilities.                                                                       Learning designers in higher education ought to adopt a design thinking mindset in order to protect students' privacy by (1) challenging ideas and assumptions regarding technology integration in general and (2) detecting what is known in User Experience (UX) design as ``dark patterns'' in online course design.},

This paper reports on a collective case study of four teaching staff who have developed DTPs with an emphasis on building a professional learning community at a higher education institution. A number of themes emerged from the cross-case data analysis: the teaching staff used DTPs for both personal and social benefits; they found it important to link their DTPs with students' learning; they developed DTPs at different levels (individual and group level); they aligned their DTPs with their underlying teaching and learning beliefs; and they found that technical and conceptual supports, as well as opportunities to discuss and share with colleagues, were necessary for the successful implementation of DTPs. The study suggests that DTPs could significantly enhance higher education teaching and learning, and through sharing of DTPs, teaching staff could build a professional learning community that enhances their capacity for teaching and professional learning.

A critical analysis of 19 texts was undertaken to track dominant and alternative ideas shaping the development of Open Education since 2002 as it broadened and developed from OER to Open Educational Practices (OEP). The paper begins by outlining the method of texts selection, including defining the three principles of social justice (redistributive, recognitive and representational justice) used as an analytical lens. Next the paper sets out findings which show where and how the principles of social justice became lost within the details of texts, or in other digital agendas and technological determinist debates. Finally, a new social justice aligned definition for Open Education is offered. The aim of the new definition is to provide new language and a strong theoretical framework for equitable education, as well as to clearly distinguish the field of Open Education from mainstream constructivist eLearning.},

  abstract = {Recent analysis examining trends in technology, the economy and the labour force shows that the world of work is changing. Based on an analysis of trends in the work of Australians each year, a new study has predicted that `as technology reduces the need for workers to complete routine, manual tasks they will spend more time focusing on people, solving more strategic problems and thinking creatively' (FYA, 2017). This has led some to the view that as well as deep and broad knowledge in key disciplines, students will need a range of skills and capabilities, including creative and critical thinking and problem solving, in order to thrive in the future world. But, what are the skills future generations will need? Have they found their way yet into teaching and learning in schools? How can we make sure that schools are able to teach and transmit them? This report considers the implications of these crucial questions for Australia, and it does so recognising that while there is a lot of discussion around the topic of key skills for the 21st century, there is little agreement yet about what the skills actually are, let alone whether they can be taught, measured or assessed. The reflections in this report, therefore, are somewhat speculative and need to be viewed as adding to the ongoing discussion around the skills our education system needs to consider in building courses and curricula for better preparing young people for their future lives. Its aims are modest: to bring together some of the current thinking around this topic and also to consider some of the work on the teaching and assessment of the skills future generations will need.},

This paper analyses the use of one such site, Chegg, which offers "homework help" and other academic services to students. Chegg is often presented as a file sharing site in the academic literature, but that is just one of many ways in which it can be used. As this paper demonstrates, Chegg can and is used for contract cheating. This is despite the apparent existence of an Honour Code on Chegg which asks students not to breach academic integrity. With pandemic led safety considerations leading to increased online teaching and assessment, the paper analyses data relating to how Chegg is used by students in five STEM subjects, namely Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Physics and Chemistry. The results show that students are using Chegg to request exam style questions. They demonstrate that contract cheating requests can be put live and answered within the short duration of an examination. The number of student requests posted for these five subjects increased by 196.25\% comparing the time period April 2019 to August 2019 with the period April 2020 to August 2020. This increase corresponds with the time when many courses moved to be delivered and assessed online. The growing number of requests indicates that students are using Chegg for assessment and exam help frequently and in a way that is not considered permissible by universities. The paper concludes by recommending that academic institutions put interventions in place to minimise the risk to educational standards posed by sites such as Chegg, particularly since increased online teaching and assessment may continue after the pandemic.},

  abstract = {Openness has been a feature of higher education for many decades, particularly through the establishment of open universities, although there remain debates about what openness means in practice. Digital technologies, some based on open principles, and digital content, aided by open licences, have both contributed recently to an extension of what is deemed possible under the heading of openness. Nevertheless, while in principle there may be greater degrees of openness available in higher education it does not mean in practice that many people can still readily avail themselves of these new opportunities to learn, not just because they do not have access to digital technologies but personal circumstances mean they also lack the necessary skills and the confidence to use such technologies in general or for education in particular. In fact it can be argued that this new openness, characterised mainly through the open educational resources movement, may actually widen rather than bridge the digital and educational divides between groups, both within and across national boundaries, through the increasing sophistication in technologies and the competencies expected of learners. This paper reviews some of the evidence supporting these different areas of interest and attempts to provide a synthesis of them. It then argues that actions may be required by many inter-mediaries to help to reduce the diverse social and cultural digital divides within education, including through the mediated use of open educational resources between teachers and learners.},

These systems focus on the learner or test-taker experience while adhering to the psychometric, pedagogical, and validity standards for high-stakes learning and assessment systems. Digital-first LAS leverage human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence to enable personalized experience, feedback, and adaptation; automated content generation; and automated scoring of text, speech, and video. Digital-first LAS are a product of an ecosystem of integrated theoretical learning and assessment frameworks that align theory and application of design and measurement practices with technology and data management, while being end-to-end digital.

  abstract = {Seventy-seven pre-service teachers enrolled in an introductory special education course completed a questionnaire on their beliefs about learning, teaching, and disability, before and after completing one of two randomly assigned training modules on Universal Design for Learning (UDL). Module A presented UDL as a strategy for meeting the specific needs of students with disabilities in a general education setting. Module B presented UDL as a framework to support all learners in the general education classroom through the creation of communities of learners. The Beliefs About Learning, Teaching, and Disability Questionnaire (BLTDQ) was administered with five subscales rated on a 6-point Likert-type scale that measure pre-service teachers' beliefs about learning and teaching, as representative of their epistemological beliefs, beliefs about disability (from pathognomonic to interventionist) and the role of the teacher in the general education classroom. Analyses of these results suggest that a significant change toward interventionist beliefs about learning, teaching, and disability occurred for participants who completed either module on UDL. Additionally, a small to moderate, positive relationship was identified between pre-service teachers' beliefs about disability and their epistemological beliefs, with the strength of this relationship increasing following their training in UDL. These findings suggest that training in UDL can have a powerful and positive impact on pre-service teachers' interventionist epistemological beliefs and beliefs about disability. Shifts toward interventionist beliefs are more likely to result in teaching practices that are more supportive of students with disabilities in general education classrooms. Implications for teacher preparation and study limitations are also discussed.},

Rapid and effective feedback of evaluations, along with an appropriate assessment strategy, can significantly improve students' performance. Furthermore, academic dishonesty is a major issue in higher education that has been aggravated by the limitations derived from the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the possible ways to mitigate this issue is to give different evaluations to each student, with the negative cost of increasing reviewing time. In this work, an open-source system developed in Python to automatically create and correct evaluations is presented. Using Jupyter Notebook as the graphical user interface, the system allows the creation of individual student question sheets, with the same structure and different parameter values, to send them to students, grade them, and send the final score back to the students. The proposed system requires little programming knowledge for the instructors to use it. The system was applied in Civil Engineering and Geological Engineering programs at the Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion, drastically reducing grading time while improving students' performance.},

The study was based on sociocultural theory as a theoretical framework and informed by interpretivism philosophical underpinnings. Twelve teachers from three tertiary educational institutions in the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia participated in semi-structured interviews. The data were analysed employing a thematic analysis approach. The findings revealed diversity, complexity and uncertainty in teacher beliefs and personal theories related to various aspects of assessment and testing. The findings also provided deeper insights into the role of contextual and institutional dynamics that influence teachers' assessment-related decision-making process. These findings have implications for teacher education and professional development programmes in terms of assessment policy, procedures and practice.},

  abstract = {Purpose               The purpose of this paper is to propose a scalable quantitative approach to evaluate alignment within and between courses and programs in higher education for benchmarking purpose.                                         Design/methodology/approach                                The revised Bloom's taxonomy, which combines a cognitive process dimension and a knowledge dimension, is used as a basis for categorizing national standards, program and course learning outcomes (CLOs) and assessment methods. Alignments between programs and national standards, programs and courses and assessment tasks and courses are then measured using a series of Cohen's                 {$\kappa$}                 statistics. Two undergraduate business programs offered at an Australian university were used as examples to demonstrate the proposed method as an alignment evaluation tool.                                                        Findings               The findings reveal that the two sample programs are better aligned with national standards than with their respective constituent courses. The degree of alignment between CLOs and assessment methods varies from course to course within the programs. This might be related to the lack of clarity of some learning outcome statements and the complexity of certain assessment methods.                                         Research limitations/implications               This study lends insight into the use of an alignment mapping for benchmarking academic programs in higher education. To serve mainly as an illustration of the proposed approach, the case study is limited to two undergraduate business programs offered at the same university.                                         Practical implications               Universities can use the proposed approach to benchmark their academic programs against the national standards and similar programs offered by other competing educational institutions. The alignment indices can also serve as yardsticks to continuously improve the consistencies within and among academic programs to ensure quality.                                         Originality/value               The proposed method offers a consistent basis to compare the degrees of alignment of different higher education programs with national standards and their respective constituent courses, hence enabling benchmarking for continuous improvement. It also reveals how the alignment between different parameters in teaching and learning can be improved, thereby facilitating incremental learning and enhancing student performance.},

  abstract = {Abstract Introduction ANKI is a programme that allows users to produce digital flashcards consisting of text, pictures and/or videos. It is based on the principle of active recall and spaced repetition creating an effective revision tool. This study investigated the benefits of ANKI digital flashcards used by 2nd year medical students when revising their musculoskeletal (MSK) module. Method A prospective study of 121 2nd year medical students at the Anglia Ruskin University. Learning objectives were stated at the start of each MSK lecture. Each student created ANKI flashcards for the learning objective assigned to them. These flashcards were combined to create a crowdsourced complete MSK deck available to the entire cohort. Anonymised student feedback was obtained at the beginning and end of the module. Results The mean value of a Likert scoring system (1least -- 5most) from both surveys was used. Pre-assignment questions assessing students' familiarity and aspiration towards ANKI: Use cards as part of revision =3.24; Comfort with IT systems=3.82; Familiar with ANKI system=4.04, Interest in using ANKI =3.88. Post assignment questions to assess the outcome success: Would you use ANKI for revision =4.55, Use ANKI in other modules =3.95. Free text responses included praise towards communal effort, manageable workload and creation of a revision resource. Conclusion ANKI provided an additional useful digital resource learning and revision for medical students. The cards created by students, for students, provided autonomy. However, this effected the quality of some slides. Overall, the feedback was positive with this assignment expanded to other modules.},

In online courses, this is compounded by students employing surface learning strategies. Furthermore, it has been shown that students often do not utilize learning materials that are provided in the structured course modules, such as lecture videos. To combat this problem, we have implemented two different solutions to improve student engagement and retention of knowledge in courses in general chemistry and precalculus. First, using the Quick Check tool in our learning management system (LMS), we have incorporated auto-graded questions that students answer directly after viewing the course materials. These aim to promote the viewing of course materials beyond homework and quizzes, including engagement with course lecture videos. Second, using an online proctoring option integrated into our LMS, we have moved to increase the extent to which exams are proctored. This encourages students to engage in more frequent reinforcement prior to exams as they will not be able to access external information sources. We show that these measures led to greater improvement in student performance between the midterm and final exam, particularly on application questions. However, the incorporation of Quick Check questions reduced student performance on formative assessments particularly on more challenging topics. The implications are discussed in terms of cognitive load theory.},

It has become more imperative now than before to better prepare our graduates for professional success in an age of increasing writing necessity, data analytics and reporting, and technical sophistication. Writing assessment in a class setting has learning goals and needs to be differentiated from a mass testing evaluation context. When learning to write well, especially relating to subject-specific content, feedback is necessary. Performing analysis and evaluation, then providing explanation and recommendations takes time. Newer digital tools can provide formative feedback; and therefore transparency about grading as well. Among teaching tasks, grading assignments consumes the majority of online faculty time. This study identifies what type of online grading could take up the majority of faculty time and specifies estimates of time needed for such grading. Faculty workload is high in adopting an optimal combined formative and summative assessment model. Results of the study might help develop more sound policies of academic support. Faculty might use the study?s information for better curricula planning and improved utilization of student assistants.},

The RARE model provides a common set of strategies for implementing principles of effective assessment practice, developed by two assessment professionals from universities located in different accrediting regions: WASC (Western Senior College and University Commission) and SACSCOC (Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges). In calling attention to the influence of their practitioner training and background, this model also highlights the benefit of exploring the disciplinary diversity that exists within the assessment field.

  abstract = {Institutions of higher education both value and need student assessment data. Faculty, as seen in numerous studies, however, have generally negatively received the formalization and reporting of student assessments to gather this assessment data. If we could better understand faculty experiences and perceptions of student assessment data within institutions of higher education, we might then be better able to serve the students enrolled. Therefore, the purpose of this interpretive phenomenological analysis was to understand faculty experiences with and perceptions of student assessment data for the betterment of student learning. Using Brown's (2004, 2008) Conception of Assessment (CoA) theory, this study sought to answer the following research question: What are the lived experiences of faculty interacting with formalized assessment practices? Interviews with faculty working within higher education found four key beliefs: first, they perceived formalized assessment as accountability in the classroom as ineffective; second, they perceived formalized assessment as accountability to accreditors as positive in theory; third, they positive perceived the potential of formalized assessment to improve the education experience; and fourth, they perceived that formalized assessment must be faculty-driven, purposeful, and scholarly. Implications for practice and future research are discussed. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

However, it is inevitably challenging to make an online learning environment authentic for learners when it is ultimately separated from their real-life contexts. Particularly, in online doctoral education, given the diversity among online learners, even defining ``what is real and to whom'' is a difficult task. This paper argues that the epistemological approach to authentic learning, based on the constructivist learning paradigm, is not sufficient to make online learning ``authentically'' meaningful. The paper introduces an alternative, ontological approach stemming from the transformative learning paradigm, and suggests autoethnography as one authentic learning activity that can effectively integrate the epistemological and ontological approaches to authentic learning in online doctoral education. Such a comprehensive conceptualisation of authentic learning, as an integrated process of both knowing and becoming, allows each doctoral student to become a more authentic self across their learning and living environments.},

Daily instruction involves understanding how learning inside disciplines should be organized to respond to the needs of particular learners. This chapter examines how opportunity to learn (OTL) can be structured in classrooms serving culturally diverse students in ways that (1) build on fundamental propositions in cognition; (2) focus on generative topics, concepts, and forms of problem solving within subject matters; and (3) scaffold forms of knowledge and ways of using language emerging from students' everyday experiences in families and communities. The basic argument is that reconceptualizing forms of assessment in the absence of reconceptualizing instruction will yield few results.In this chapter, OTL means students have a right to rigorous instruction that:1) is organized in ways to build on and expand forms of prior knowledge they construct from their experiences outside school and across their years of schooling;2) provides them with models of expertise (e.g., models of more expert problem solving) and in-time feedback on the progress of their learning in ways that are usable and motivating; and3) focuses on powerful and generative topics, concepts, and problem-solving strategies within academic subject matters and across their years of schooling in ways that help them make sense of how their learning is useful in the world.In order for these opportunities to take root, several important issues must be addressed. First, we must have good operational definitions and illustrations of learning within subject matters from a developmental perspective.},

  abstract = {It is a hard task to strike a balance between extents of control a learner exercises and the amount of guidance, active or passive, afforded by the learning environment to guide, support, and motivate the learner. Adaptive systems strive to find the right balance in a spectrum that spans between self-control and system-guidance. They also concern a smoother shifting of the balance point during learning episodes in light of competing requirements from learning goals, learner capacity, instructional affordances, and educational theories, among others. This research investigates one of the extremes of this spectrum, where learners actively assume control and take responsibility for their own learning, while catering to individual preferences with little or no guidance from the e-learning environment. In this study, one unit material from an online Introduction to Java Programming course has been redesigned based on the proposed Learner-Directed Model for the experimental design study. The model is developed based on the exploration of two educational theories---Experiential-Learning Theory (ELT) and Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) Theory. The study involved a total of 35 participants (N = 35) divided randomly into one Experimental Group and one Control Group. They were assigned to either a Learner-Directed Model (Experimental Group) or a linear model (Control Group). Pre/post tests, survey, follow-up interview as well as log file analysis were instruments used for assessing students' domain knowledge, meta-knowledge, and their attitudes for their overall learning experience. The results of the study have revealed that there is a statistically significant higher level of overall learning experience and better learning attitudes compared to Control Group students who studied with e-learning components that are linear in nature and are without explicit associations with educational theories.

  abstract = {Although artificial Intelligence (AI) is prevalent and impacts facets of daily life, there is limited research on responsible and humanistic design, implementation, and evaluation of AI, especially in the field of education. Afterall, learning is inherently a social endeavor involving human interactions, rendering the need for AI designs to be approached from a humanistic perspective, or human-centered AI (HAI). This study focuses on the use of essays as a principal means for assessing learning outcomes, through students' writing in subjects that require arguments and justifications, such as ethics and moral reasoning. We considered AI with a human and student-centric design for formative assessment, using an automated essay scoring (AES) and feedback system to address issues of running an online course with large enrolment and to provide efficient feedback to students with substantial time savings for the instructor. The development of the AES system occurred over four phases as part of an iterative design cycle. A mixed-method approach was used, allowing instructors to qualitatively code subsets of data for training a machine learning model based on the Random Forest algorithm. This model was subsequently used to automatically score more essays at scale. Findings show substantial agreement on inter-rater reliability before model training was conducted with acceptable training accuracy. The AES system's performance was slightly less accurate than human raters but is improvable over multiple iterations of the iterative design cycle. This system has allowed instructors to provide formative feedback, which was not possible in previous runs of the course.},

However, the associations between these learner factors and the actual application of technology for individualized and collaborative school-related learning activities in a specific domain and in the Asian context are not adequately discussed. This paper contributes to the literature by attempting to investigate such correlations, and treating individualized and collaborative applications as separate entities, with particular reference to Chinese adolescent learners of English in Hong Kong. An analysis of 193 questionnaires completed by adolescent English learners aged 13--16 in three Hong Kong secondary schools supported the differentiation of actual application for individualized and collaborative school-related English learning activities. While the adolescents' attitudes, self-efficacy (familiarity with technology) and perceptions towards technology use were positive, attitude was related to use of technology for individualized learning purposes, and self-efficacy was related to perceived usefulness of technology for English learning. Their perceived usefulness of technology and actual application behavior for school-related learning tasks were not commensurate with each other. Older adolescent learners tended to favor more technology as a useful tool for English learning. Gender effects, however, were negligible. The study points to the significance of understanding both learner perceptions and relations with actual application of technology use for school-related English learning activities.},

Online assessment can be challenging to both teachers and students due to technical, academic, and ethical issues. In this survey, we adopted both qualitative and quantitative approaches to evaluate (1) the perceived effectiveness of online assessment; (2) barriers and problems of using online assessment; and (3) suggestions for improvement. The online survey was conducted in May 2020, 752 full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students had completed the questionnaires. Forty-three undergraduate students attended an individual interview between May and June 2020. A total of 739 (98.3\%) students had the experience of taking online assessment during COVID-19 outbreak. The survey results revealed that only 16.6\% of students were satisfied with their online assessment arrangements. The major difficulty that students encountered was technical problems (52.6\%). Majority of students (72.6\%) agreed that online assessments were more affected by computer problems and internet connection when compared with traditional examination. Students expressed that teachers' feedback was essential for their learning, and they wished to receive timely and detailed feedback on their performance. Students suggested that technical support should be provided, and standardized measures should be taken to ensure academic honesty.},

Yet results are inconsistent in establishing the strength of the relationships, limiting understanding of the theoretical impact and practical reach of the servant leadership (SL ) construct. Using a quantitative meta-analysis based on 130 independent studies, the current research provides evidence that SL has incremental predictive validity over transformational, authentic, and ethical leadership. Further, the link between SL and a range of individual- and team-level behavioural outcomes can be partially explained by trust in the leader, procedural justice, and leader--member exchange. The paper also explores moderators to better establish SL 's criterion-related validity and to clarify the magnitude of effects across boundary conditions, such as research design, national culture, and industry.}

  abstract = {Educators in large-scale online courses tend to lack the necessary resources to generate and provide adequate feedback for all students, especially when students' learning outcomes are evaluated through student writing. As a result, students welcome peer feedback and sometimes generate self-feedback to widen their perspectives and obtain feedback, but often lack the support to do so. This study, as part of a larger project, sought to address this prevalent problem in large-scale courses by allowing students to write essays as an expression of their opinions and response to others, conduct peer and self-evaluation, using provided rubric and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled evaluation to aid the giving and receiving of feedback. A total of 605 undergraduate students were part of a large-scale online course and contributed over 2500 short essays during a semester. The research design uses a mixed-methods approach, consisting qualitative measures used during essay coding, and quantitative methods from the application of machine learning algorithms. With limited instructors and resources, students first use instructor-developed rubric to conduct peer and self-assessment, while instructors qualitatively code a subset of essays that are used as inputs for training a machine learning model, which is subsequently used to provide automated scores and an accuracy rate for the remaining essays. With AI-enabled evaluation, the provision of feedback can become a sustainable process with students receiving and using meaningful feedback for their work, entailing shared responsibility from teachers and students, and becoming more effective. {$\bullet$}Educators lack resources to provide adequate student assessment feedback.{$\bullet$}Students need support for peer and self-evaluations to be sustainable.{$\bullet$}Prototype essay scoring system with AI supports students' generated feedback.{$\bullet$}Shared responsibility between educators and students critical for sustainability.{$\bullet$}Inception in undergraduate course shows feasibility and scalability.},

A lack of a clear and overarching conceptualisation of assessment quality can cause difficulties in guaranteeing assessment quality. Thus, the aim of this study is to conceptualise assessment quality in tertiary education by providing an overview of the assessment quality criteria, their influences, the evaluation of the assessment quality criteria, and the perspectives that should be considered when evaluating assessment quality. This study aggregated 78 peer-reviewed journal articles in a framework using MAXQDA, and a text analysis was performed using Leximancer. The results identified validity, transparency, and reliability as assessment quality criteria; standardisation, stakeholders, clarity, and construct irrelevant variance as influences on the assessment quality criteria; validation and statistical data analyses to evaluate assessment quality; and students, staff, government, and experts as perspectives that should be considered when evaluating assessment quality. These insights are important for teachers, educational advisors, and managers who can use this information to determine what assessment quality means for their educational organisation and what they should consider when guaranteeing assessment quality. Moreover, the study provides researchers with insight into the current state of scientific evidence.},

Water-intensive data centres, polluting mineral extraction and e-waste dumping are incontrovertibly part of AI's footprint. In this article, I turn to areas affected by AI-fuelled environmental harm and identify an ethics of resistance emerging from local activists, which I term `elemental ethics'. Elemental ethics interrogates the AI value chain's problematic relationship with the elements that make up the world, critiques the undermining of local and ancestral approaches to nature and reveals the vital and quotidian harms engendered by so-called intelligent systems. While this ethics is emerging from grassroots and Indigenous groups, it echoes recent calls from environmental philosophy to reconnect with the environment via the elements. In empirical terms, this article looks at groups in Chile resisting a Google data centre project in Santiago and lithium extraction (used for rechargeable batteries) in Lickan Antay Indigenous territory, Atacama Desert. As I show, elemental ethics can complement top-down, utilitarian and quantitative approaches to AI ethics and sustainable AI as well as interrogate whose lived experience and well-being counts in debates on AI extinction.},

Participants were 60 tertiary students in two classes engaging in knowledge building and reflecting on their collaborative knowledge building using e-portfolios; one class was a principle-based knowledge-building environment (KBP, n = 30), and the other a regular knowledge-building environment (KBR, n = 30). The KF embedded assessment tools, the Analytical Toolkit and Applet, showed increased KF participation and connectedness during the year. Regression analysis showed that KF participation predicted conceptual understanding for both classes. Analyses of e-portfolios revealed that the students adopted nine reflective strategies in knowledge building, and that reflective metadiscourse strategies involving metacognitive and collective processes were related with deeper conceptual understanding. Analyses of online discourse threads further showed that metadiscourse involving collective processes was associated with higher levels of knowledge advances. Both classes showed improvement and the KBP class outperformed the KBR class on KF participation, metadiscourse processes and conceptual understanding. This study has theoretical implications advancing the idea of metadiscourse, discourse about discourse, for enriching research on knowledge building and computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). There are also design implications for using principle-based e-portfolios to facilitate collective reflection and metadiscourse to address issues of fragmented online discussion, and for promoting sustained inquiry.},

The objective of this article is to advance three claims about why teachers and assessment scholars/specialists may have little understanding of students? interpretation of formative assessment feedback. The three claims are as follows. First, there is little systematic research of K-12 students? interpretations of feedback. Systematic research requires gathering substantive evidence of students? cognitive and emotional processes using psychological methods and tools. Second, there is an overemphasis on the external assessment process at the expense of uncovering learners? internal reasoning and emotional processes. This overemphasis may be due to vestiges of behavioral approaches and lack of training in social cognitive methods. Third, there are psychological tools such as the clinical interview, pioneered by Piaget and used by psychologists to ?enter the child's mind,? which may be helpful in uncovering students? interpretation of feedback and associated behavioral responses. If the purpose of formative assessment is to change student learning, and feedback is delivered as a conduit to help with this long-term change, understanding students? interpretation of feedback plays a central role in the validity of the process.},

Following the call of Oman Vision 2040 to emphasize educational practices that promote the development of higher-order cognitive processes, this study raises the following question: Can an online multiple choice question (MCQ) quiz tap into the higher-order cognitive skills of "apply," "analyze" and "evaluate?" This question was also critical at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic when Omani universities switched to the online learning mode. The researchers administered an online MCQ quiz to 35 undergraduate students enrolled in an ESP course for Engineering and Sciences. The results showed that MCQ quizzes could be developed to tap into higher-order thinking skills when the stem of the MSQ is developed as a task or a scenario. The study also revealed that students performed better on MCQs that tap into low-level cognitive skills. This result can be attributed to the prevalent practice in Oman to develop assessment tools that tap only into a level of Bloom's taxonomy, which involves the cognitive process of retrieving memorized information. The significance of the study lies in its pedagogical applications. The study calls for the use of teaching and assessment practices that target the development of higher-order thinking skills, which is aligned with the country's strategic direction reflected in Oman vision 2040.},

  abstract = {Peer assessment brings new affordances to the implementation of meaningful assessment on online courses (e.g. MOOCs) by using technological solutions to automate the assessment process. For this reason, teachers need digital pedagogic skills for planning, implementing and developing effective peer assessment models. In this paper we apply the criteria of a good peer assessment task to peer review the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) automatic evaluation path (peer assessment case) designed by one of the authors. Our collegial review employs a set of criteria teachers can use to develop peer assessment tasks in their teaching. The peer review describes the strengths and development needs of the DIY case. The case indicates that a successful peer assessment task also requires teachers to recognize changes in their role in a learning activity. Based on the peer review, the potential for the DIY model to provide automated peer assessment practices in game-oriented learning processes is acknowledged.},

Although the use of video content as a learning resource has recently increased in both educational and non-educational contexts, there is very little research on its effectiveness as assessment feedback and the existing results are contradictory. For that reason, we have combined in this work the use of a web-based formative assessment system (Siette) where we have integrated a specific type of video podcast (modular teaching mini-videos: MTMs) and equivalent illustrated text. We have carried out two experiments with a twofold purpose, first to compare the effect of video feedback versus correct response feedback alone and secondly to compare the effect of video feedback versus equivalent illustrated text feedback. In the context of our research, a Statistic Course at university level, our results show, as expected, that there is a statistically significant positive effect in favor of video feedback over correct response feedback alone. Surprisingly, in contrast to our expectations, based on our context of acquisition of procedural knowledge, there is a statistically non-significant effect of video feedback versus equivalent illustrated text feedback. From the students' satisfaction survey, there is not statistically significant differences in the overall score of the activity based on video podcast feedback or equivalent illustrated text, which is an indication that we have really obtained equivalent feedback materials.},

Nursing students need to practise nursing skills and follow specific clinical procedures in wards. In this study, they were provided with a mobile device for learning purposes, with mobile apps preinstalled for watching nursing videos and conducting clinical assessments. The evaluation was conducted following the Framework for the Rational Analysis of Mobile Education (FRAME). It included a questionnaire survey involving 265 nursing students and focus group interviews with 20 nursing students, the course coordinator of the clinical practicum and the instructional designer of the mobile apps. The participants shared their views, perceptions and experiences of mobile learning for studying nursing skills and conducting clinical assessment in the practicum context. The results showed the participants' overall satisfaction with the mobile learning practice. They gave positive feedback on the use of the mobile apps in terms of enabling ubiquitous access to materials for situated learning in wards, and offering effective support for teachers to keep track of students' learning progress. They also suggested areas for improvements, which emphasised the hardware capacity of devices, training on the use of apps and institutional support for the maintenance of devices. The results of factor analysis showed a composition of underlying factors different from that of the original FRAME model, which suggests contextual variation in the application of the model.},

This has led to an increased interest in different approaches to the assessment of online distance learners, including how to enhance student authentication and reduce the potential for cheating in online tests. One potential solution for this is the use of remote live invigilation. This work reports on a small scale pilot study where a group of 17 online distance learning Computer Science students from 7 different countries (Egypt, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Trinidad \& Tobago, United Kingdom, Zambia) took part in an online test using remote live invigilation. Some examinees expressed concerns about data security and privacy. Furthermore, some examinees expressed concerns about the extent to which the remote live invigilation process would be intrusive, and impact negatively on their online assessment experience. Overall, findings from this study suggest that the remote live invigilation did not affect the assessment experience of the examinees in any way, with some examinees reporting that knowing that a live proctor was present gave them "peace of mind" in case technical problems occurred during the online test. Additionally, examinees suggested that remote live invigilation should be used more widely in online distance learning programmes as a means to enhance credibility.},

Researchers have developed various assessments for maker activities to examine students' learning outcomes. However, a systematic review of research on such assessments is lacking. To fill this gap, we reviewed empirical studies on maker-based assessments in education. We systematically examined 60 studies regarding the overall features of the maker activities, the learning outcomes that were measured, the assessment formats, and the psychometric evidence of the assessments. Our review results indicate that more than 20 types of maker platforms have been employed in the activities, with e-textiles and LilyPad Arduino being the most popular. Five types of assessment tools have been used prevalently to examine students' diverse learning outcomes, specifically artifact assessments, tests, surveys, interviews, and observations. Most assessments are used in STEM-related maker activities, especially technology-centric activities, to measure STEM-related learning outcomes. Only 15\% of the studies provide psychometric evidence of reliability and validity for the assessments. Based on the findings, we provide suggestions for future research which include developing more low-tech maker activities for students in lower-grades and with lower technology proficiency. In addition, future studies should improve rubrics for artifact assessment and explore more assessment tools for non-STEM subjects. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Narrative Inquiry is a research methodology that we adapted over the past two decades from Canadian higher education and curriculum studies to nursing research, education, and health-care practice. The Narrative Inquiry we use originated from Connelly and Clandinin in the 1990s, and rests on John Dewey?s philosophy that experience is relational, temporal, and situational, and as such, if intentionally explored, has the potential to be educational. More specifically, it is only when experience is reflected upon and reconstructed that it has the potential to reveal the construction of identity, knowledge, and the humanness of care. Congruent with the expectation that nurses are reflective practitioners and knowledge-makers, Narrative Inquiry provides a means to enhance, not only quality of care, but quality of experience of those in our care: in education, our students, and in practice, our patients. In this article, we explicate how Narrative Inquiry may be lived in health-care education and practice, with a primary focus on nursing. We illuminate how we support our graduate students, the next generation of narrative inquirers, through a Narrative Inquiry Works-in-Progress group.}

This concern has grown with the increase of peer assessment in digital platforms. In this meta-analysis, using a variance-known hierarchical linear modelling approach, we synthesise findings from studies on peer assessment since 1999 when computer-assisted peer assessment started to proliferate. The estimated average Pearson correlation between peer and teacher ratings is found to be 0.63, which is moderately strong. This correlation is significantly higher when: (a) the peer assessment is paper-based rather than computer-assisted; (b) the subject area is not medical/clinical; (c) the course is graduate level rather than undergraduate or K-12; (d) individual work instead of group work is assessed; (e) the assessors and assessees are matched at random; (f) the peer assessment is voluntary instead of compulsory; (g) the peer assessment is non-anonymous; (h) peer raters provide both scores and qualitative comments instead of only scores; and (i) peer raters are involved in developing the rating criteria. The findings are expected to inform practitioners regarding peer assessment practices that are more likely to exhibit better agreement with teacher assessment.},

Studies have found that studying, academic pressure, university culture and systems can affect students' mental health. There are increasing calls for universities to take a compassionate, holistic approach to supporting student wellbeing, and identify the barriers that are created by university cultures, systems, pedagogies, curricula, tuition and assessment practices. This study aimed to identify barriers and enablers to student mental wellbeing in distance learning, and students' recommendations for changes to be made. Using a student survey (N\,=\,584), we identified that assessment and life circumstances were the most significant barriers, while the greatest enablers were building study skills, the people in students' lives, and curriculum and module content. The study revealed significant demographic differences in how students experience barriers and enablers, and how likely they feel they are to benefit from solutions. Students with disclosed mental health difficulties were consistently more likely to experience barriers than students without a disclosure, while enablers were experienced by all demographic groups. The study concludes that assessment should be prioritised as an area for action.},

At the same time, we left sufficient space for the students to tune the final assignment to their interests, creativity, and mathematical skills. In our experience, this setup makes assessment meaningful and enjoyable for both the students and the teacher and does not need to demand excessive time investment on the teacher's side. We strongly believe that approaches like ours will have potential lasting effects on the diversity of assessment, quality of learning, and, last but not least, the appeal of Statistics for future engineers.},

  abstract = {The objectives of this work are to investigate the impact of automating the student assessment process using the Schoology web-based learning management system as an example and determine its effectiveness and usability by performing a comparative analysis between the survey results of educators and students. The research methodology is based on an exploratory survey using a data collection questionnaire composed of closed-ended questions. The respondents are 630 students and 159 faculty members from three Chinese higher education institutions. The data analysis enables the conclusion that the overall student and faculty satisfaction with Schoology is high (83.4\% and 55\%, respectively). The students and educators indicate that with the introduction of Schoology, learning and teaching became easier (82.5\% and 53.4\%, respectively). In line with this, the analysis of the effect of the automated performance assessment implementation on student academic performance find that learners are more prone to better learning outcomes after this system's launching. The practical significance of this paper is that it demonstrates the positive influence of the Schoology system on educational process effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Open (open-book) online assessment has become a great tool in higher education, which is frequently used for monitoring learning progress and teaching effectiveness. It has been gaining popularity because it is flexible to use and makes response behavior data available for researchers to study response processes. However, some challenges are encountered in analyzing these data, such as how to handle outlying response time, how to make use of the information from item response order, how item response time, response order and item scores are related, and how to help classroom teachers quickly check whether student responses are aligned with the design of the assessment. The purposes of this study are 3-fold: (1) to provide a solution for handling outlying response times due to the design of open online formative assessments (i.e., ample or unrestricted testing time), (2) to propose a new measure for investigating the item response order, and (3) to discuss two analytical approaches that are useful for studying response behaviors-data visualization and the Bayesian generalized linear mixed effects model (B-GLMM). An application of these two approaches is illustrated using open online quiz data. Our findings obtained from B-GLMM showed that item response order was related to item response time, but not to item scores; and item response time was related to item scores, but its effects were moderated by the cognitive level. Additionally, the findings from both B-GLMM and data visualization were consistent, which assisted instructors to see the alignment of student responses with the assessment design.},

The purpose of this study was to determine educational effectiveness, as well as danger, the effectiveness of the digital environment in developing social skills and achieving learning quality in a new generation. The study was conducted in the form of a survey among 60 students from Gulin Tourism University and Moscow State Pedagogical University; they were divided into two groups, the methods of cooperative and collaborative co-education with immersion in a digital environment were used. A control group consisted of at least 30 students. The real effectiveness of training was tested both by the solution of task and by independent testing that was obtained in the process of solving. A separate survey was conducted to establish a subjective assessment by students of the social skills and interaction. The survey was conducted according to the methods that have been developed over the past 6 years by different groups of researchers. Consequently, it was found out that co-learning technologies do not influence the quality of training and the assimilation, and students immersed in a digital environment showed even better results. The number of students with most correct answers for the test was 46.67\% and 23.33\% in study groups, and only 10\% - in control group. Generally, the results of a subjective assessment of social skills coincides with similar data obtained by other researchers and shows an improvement of collaboration in inhomogeneous groups, slighter leadership in common problems solving, and very low conflict indicators.

  abstract = {Online assessment takes many forms. While there have been reviews on a particular online assessment approach (e.g., online examinations or tests), there has not been a knowledge synthesis that considers online assessment research as a whole. A holistic understanding of online assessment research is important, as it recognizes differences in assessment approaches and the role of technologies in assessment. This understanding helps researchers navigate the heterogeneous body of research and allows educators to make research-informed improvements. To establish such an understanding, we analyzed 235 articles, following a mapping review and a narrative synthesis method. The findings revealed tests, assignments and skills assessments are major online assessment approaches. While research into tests reported using online technologies mainly to substitute or augment existing assessment, research into assignments and skills assessments was more likely to report using online technologies to modify or redefine assessment. Further, we identified disparities across the three approaches regarding academic misconduct, assessment validity, and reliability. We also identified a dearth of comparative research and a reliance on overall satisfaction and short-term self-reported impact measures as indicators of success. We discuss the implications of this review to provide insights for institutions and educators seeking to improve online assessment practices.},

  abstract = {Currently, the training of the future work force presents challenging problems to higher education. This training, in the form of practical and theoretical knowledge can come from multiple platforms, channels and means, both formal and informal. In addition, it is quite difficult to assess the knowledge skill level that a student has acquired to optimize their chances for future employability. This, together with the need to still manage academic curricula on paper, the problems of confidence when validating these documents and contrasting them with real knowledge, etc., means that management in higher education requires revolutionary new tools. This work evaluates the benefits of the blockchain (or distributed ledger) technology and advocates a decentralised model of confidence for transactions based on an academic crypto currency. In this approach blockchain is used to manage transactions of content, teaching and competencies, assessed by consensus by students, trainers and employers, to eliminate once and for all the ``gap'' between the academic world and the working world. This paper aims to address the current challenges of an increasingly dispersed, open and ubiquitous higher education. The proposed model can be implemented in any training institution to adapt its teaching to the specific needs of professional profiles validated by employers in the sector. This model has been validated by means of a prototype with more than acceptable results.},

A comprehensive literature review resulted in a framework of relevant skills, namely soft, hard, and data analytics skills. Their importance was evaluated using a Delphi method. In order to determine the relationships between involved stakeholders, their roles and requirements, a stakeholder theory is utilized. It resulted in the identification of current and emerging roles of stakeholders in the data analytics ecosystem. A structural classification of stakeholders' influences and impacts then represents a necessary background for establishing strategies for the development of the right skills needed to gain the value from these data.

We also limited our search to studies with undergraduate and graduate students, application of an empirical methodological design, and descriptions of methodology, data analysis, and results with sufficient detail to assure verifiability of data collection and analysis. Our analysis of the patterns and trends in the corpus of 104 research studies led to identification of five themes: course design factors, student support, faculty pedagogy, student engagement, and student success factors. Most of the strategies with promising effectiveness in the online environment are the same ones that are considered to be effective in face-to-face classrooms including the use of multiple pedagogies and learning resources to address different student learning needs, high instructor presence, quality of faculty-student interaction, academic support outside of class, and promotion of classroom cohesion and trust. Unique to the online environment are user-friendly technology tools, orientation to online instruction, opportunities for synchronous class sessions, and incorporation of social media. Given the few studies utilizing methodological designs from which claims of causality can be made or meta-analyses could be conducted, we identified only faculty feedback as an evidence-based practice and no specific intervention that we could identify as research-based in online instruction.},

  abstract = {When you think of what SoTL inquiry is, as inquiry, how do you conceptualize it? What assumptions do you make, and where do those assumptions come from? I have a sneaking suspicion that we have devoted far too little attention to the basic underlying assumptions that we hold about scholarly inquiry, and that these assumptions are exerting problematic influence on SoTL. In this presentation, I will critically examine the way we conceptualize SoTL in the literature, in order to suggest a better way of approaching it. I will start by problematizing the common idea of situating SoTL in relation to the disciplines and educational research, arguing that this way of conceptualizing SoTL leads to disciplinary ideas of research exerting problematic influence on SoTL. This puts SoTL between the mythological monster Scylla (disciplinary research) and the deadly whirlpool Charybdis (educational research): Scylla's many heads would fragment SoTL, whereas Charybdis' vortex would consume it completely. To avoid this, a fundamental paradigm view of inquiry, decoupled from the disciplines, would be more suitable for SoTL. As a way of approaching this paradigm view of SoTL, I use the concept of knowledge-constitutive interests from the early work of German critical theorist J{\quotesinglbase}rgen Habermas (1971). I outline a more fundamental starting point for conceptualizing SoTL that allows SoTL to be its own form of inquiry with its own nature, rather than a twisted offshoot of disciplinary research, some sort of interdisciplinary mutt, or the poor cousin of educational research. Finally, I use this new way of conceptualizing SoTL to propose an approach that recognizes the special nature of SoTL and has the potential to simply eliminate many of the conflicts that seem to pervade the conceptual literature on SoTL.}

The C{$\flat$}-model is a theoretical framework that systematizes contextual factors, which influence students` learning activities as the most important facilitator of students' learning success. Using a self-assessment instrument with anchored scenarios in a sample of 1625 higher education teachers, we were able to identify three levels at which higher education teachers initiated digital learning activities: a low level (powerpointers), a moderate level (clickerers), and a high level (digital pros). The findings also support the relevance of the contextual factors specified in the C{$\flat$}-model for initiating a high level of digital learning activities, namely digitalization policy and commitment of university administration, institutional equipment, technical and educational support, self-assessed basic digital skills, and self-assessed technology-related teaching skills. All of these factors explain a substantial amount of variance in the level of initiated digital learning activities.

In this paper we present, firstly, an expanded conceptualisation of teachers' assessment work. Drawing on research on teacher identity, we posit that teachers' identity as professionals, beliefs about assessment, disposition towards enacting assessment, and perceptions of their role as assessors are all significant for their assessment work. We term this reconceptualisation Teacher Assessment Identity (TAI). Secondly, in support of this conceptual work, we present findings from a systematic review of self-report scales on teacher assessment literacy and teacher identity related to assessment. The findings demonstrate that such scales and previous research exploring teacher assessment practices have paid limited attention to what we identify as essential and broader dimensions of TAI. We share our reconceptualisation and analyses to encourage others to consider teacher assessment work more broadly in their research.},

Method: We conducted a literature review following a two-step procedure, looking for papers using the major search engines and selection based on certain criteria. Results: The document search process yielded 133 results, 82 of which were selected in order to answer some essential research questions in the area. The selected papers were grouped and described by the type of educational systems, the data mining techniques applied, the variables or features used, and how early accurate prediction was possible. Conclusions: Most of the papers analyzed were about online learning systems and traditional face-to-face learning in secondary and tertiary education; the most commonly-used predictive algorithms were J48, Random Forest, SVM, and Naive Bayes (classification), and logistic and linear regression (regression). The most important factors in early prediction were related to student assessment and data obtained from student interaction with Learning Management Systems. Finally, how early it was possible to make predictions depended on the type of educational system. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Universities are facing the challenge of updating the contents of their current study programs and adopting novel education strategies in order to prepare the next generation of engineers who can adapt to the highly competitive labor market of Industry 4.0. This new industrial era requires skills and competencies in state-of-the-art technologies which are constantly and rapidly evolving. This research presents an alternative approach to the current teaching--learning methodologies, focusing on the use of Virtual Reality (VR) as an educational tool and its contribution towards the upcoming industrial challenges, via what we call interactive education for future engineers (IE). Our IE strategy is supported by interactive simulation using the latest VR technologies, currently being Facebook's Oculus Rift hardware and software. With this approach, we seek to enhance the ``know-how'' of our students by training them in the practical skills they will need for the technological innovations of the evolving labor market. Our work has been implemented in engineering courses at Tecnologico de Monterrey in Mexico, aligning with the university's educational model ``TEC21'' which aims to increase the students' self-learning capabilities using interactive teaching and hands-on practical work to develop new abilities and competencies in an expanded variety of domains. So far, our results have shown that the use of IE not only improves the way professors teach, but reinforces skills, competencies, enhances creativity and strongly motivates the students in their daily learning.},

In interviews I conducted with Indigenous sexual exploitation survivors and intervention staff I found that social media is being used to recruit Indigenous girls and keep them exploited in three distinct ways: targeting girls in reserve communities and luring them to the city; setting up so-called dates to keep them off the streets; and facilitating constant communication between the victim and victimizer, thus ensuring that girls are perpetually active and reachable. I respond to these by outlining educational possibilities in order to combat the exposure of these girls to predators on social media sites.},

The sample of 1204 students completed the TAMC-SF and other measures online. The results of tests of invariance found support for partial scalar invariance across country and gender on the TAMC-SF. In addition, results of a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and analysis of variances (ANOVAs) found country and gender differences on the TAMC-SF scales. Furthermore, validity evidence for the TAMC-SF scores with the scores of external measures was found. Overall, the findings support the use of the same test score interpretation for Canadian and US higher education students on the TAMC-SF and the use of the TAMC-SF in Canadian higher education students.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present the concept of AI Readiness, along with a framework for developing AI Readiness training. `AI Readiness' can be framed as a contextualised way of helping people to understand AI, in particular, data-driven AI. The nature of AI Readiness training is not the same as merely learning about AI. Rather, AI Readiness recognises the diversity of the professions, workplaces and sectors for whom AI has a potential impact. For example, AI Readiness for lawyers may be based on the same principles as AI Readiness for Educators. However, the details will be contextualised differently. AI Readiness recognises that such contextualisation is not an option: it is essential due to the multiple intricacies, sensitivities and variations between different sectors and their settings, which all impact the application of AI. To embrace such contextualisation, AI Readiness needs to be an active, participatory training process and aims to empower people to be more able to leverage AI to meet their needs. The text that follows focuses on AI Readiness within the Education and Training sector and starts with a discussion of the current state of AI within education and training, and the need for AI Readiness. We then problematize the concept of AI Readiness, why AI Readiness is needed, and what it means. We expand upon the nature of AI Readiness through a discussion of the difference between human and Artificial Intelligence, before presenting a 7-step framework for helping people to become AI Ready. Finally, we use an example of AI Readiness in action within Higher Education to exemplify AI Readiness.},

Self-determination theory espouses the centrality of autonomy, competence, and relatedness to human motivation. Servant leadership emphasizes serving and caring for others. Ethical leaders consistently make morally reasoned decisions. Emotionally intelligent leaders are self-aware and self-regulating, nurture motivation, and stress empathy and social skill. An analysis of the literature revealed 10 shared characteristics connecting the three components of self-determination theory, including awareness, empathy, fairness, integrity, moral values, motivation, trust, relationship management, respect, and self-management. Synergies among ethical leadership, servant leadership, and emotional intelligence to leadership in a variety of settings emerged. Effective leaders use awareness, empathy, fairness, integrity, moral values, motivation, trust, relationship management, respect, and self-management contributing to needs satisfaction in followers' autonomy, competence, and relatedness. In conclusion, leadership effectiveness can increase when leaders demonstrate integrity, trust, and respect, serve others with empathy and fairness, and are personally and socially competent.

It examines 33 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2013 and 2019 from six databases. Results show that most assessment tools are designed for computing science and engineering undergraduates or pre-service and in-service teachers in these subjects. Most tools involve in-class interventions to promote CT skills. Several assessment formats were adopted in the selected studies, including selected-response questions, constructed-response questions, Likert scales, interviews, programming artefacts, observations, and interviews. Finally, most assessment instruments attempt to measure skills from a combination of dimensions including CT Concepts, Practices, and Perspectives from a hybrid-competency framework. More specifically, the skills assessed in most studies are algorithmic thinking, problem solving, data, logic and logical thinking, and abstraction. Findings may help instructors to select CT assessments for higher education and researchers to focus on less explored research areas.},

This study employs a qualitative case study approach. Of three participants from different universities were voluntarily participated in a semi-structured interview. The interview seeks to investigate the perceptions of teachers towards technology-enhanced assessment, the roles of technology in formative assessment, and the impact of technology on language learning. The findings reveal that EFL teachers view formative assessment as well as technology in a positive perception. They admit that technology is a practical tool that has multiple roles and it is deemed as useful and meaningful platform for assessing students. Finally, technology-enhanced formative assessment gives an impact on students performance, particularly on language accuracy. The further implications are discussed in this paper.},

The data also indicate that the incorporation of self- and peer-assessment and feedback resulted in higher quality learning outcomes and enhanced critical thinking skills.},

The QM Rubric for course design is widely used in higher education. However, research about its use in nursing education is understudied. This pilot project compared 100\% online courses--two courses redesigned to meet QM standards and two traditionally designed courses by faculty. Student outcomes such as quality of online discussion forums, student end of course evaluations, and end-of-course grades, were measured and analyzed. The data analysis included descriptive statistics and parametric group comparisons. Results showed that all indicators, although not statistically significant, were more positive in the QM-redesigned courses. As online education programs continue to explode, assurance of quality in course design is a key factor in meeting student needs.},

  abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, universities were required to swiftly alter their approaches to assessing students. A number of countries around the world, especially those in resource-constrained environments, faced significant challenges in implementing successful online assessments amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, there is a noticeable dearth of research about the experiences of students in Southern Africa on online assessments. This study explores and describe undergraduate nursing students' experiences with regards to online assessment amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in Southern Africa. A qualitative explorative study was employed on 17 undergraduate nursing students recruited via purposive sampling. Data was acquired through a semi-structured interview guide for individual telephonic interviews. Data was analysed thematically using Tesch's eight-steps method. The research study identified three key topics: (1) positive experiences of online assessments; (2) challenges encountered with online assessments; and (3) suggested methods for enhancing online assessments. The results demonstrate that students from both universities encountered more difficulties and obstacles than advantages while completing their online assessments. The study participants expressed stress associated with several factors, including insufficient technical know-how, unreliable internet connectivity, and power outages. Insufficient technical expertise posed a challenge to participants in the completion of the online assessment, thereby impeding their success. It is imperative that universities provide ongoing technical training to enable the effective integration of technology both in present and future pandemics. It is suggested that future research focus on devising approaches for implementing online assessment.},

Within my own religious and theological university environment, I have sought to address some of these challenges in the development of a Doing Theology Capstone Unit. This paper outlines the key subject information of the unit, followed by five key areas that informed the development. It is argued that by taking seriously the teaching and learning nexus, requires paying attention to these five key areas. The discussion section of this paper, therefore, explores demographics and diversity, active learning, constructive alignment, assessment and technology. These five areas are explored in relation to the developed curriculum for the Doing Theology unit. It is argued that by paying attention to these areas we can enable greater student engagement and peer-to-peer participation.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial social, economic, political, and educational impact worldwide. Due to the social contact restrictions, areas such as medical education were highly affected. Assessment in medical education, was already a sensitive topic, and it proved to be even more challenging as different teaching and learning contexts required huge adaptations in a short period. This systematic review provides an overview of the impact of COVID-19 on the assessment of medical students and can serve as a reference to improve this area. We conducted the review based on the PRISMA tool and searched in PubMed, EBSCO, and ScienceDirect. Studies describing the assessment methodologies used during the pandemic were included. Of the 501 initial articles, 18 were included in this review. Collected data was based on the regime, subject, teaching/assessment methodologies, platforms used, grades, students' and teachers' perceptions, and measures to prevent academic dishonesty. The results suggest that technology played a central role during the pandemic, and universities were concerned about the transition to online learning regarding teaching and assessment, but students and teachers should be prepared for it. Formative assessment methodologies and feedback were emphasized, and summative tools were adapted to prevent fraud. Students and teachers were generally satisfied with online learning and assessment, which had no significant difference in the examination scores, but they preferred conventional teaching. The COVID-19 pandemic brought an opportunity to analyze and rethink the medical curriculum. Thus, further investigations are needed on combining traditional and online teaching strategies and emphasis on the assessment.},

They annotated the videos using time-stamped comments and shared them with their supervisors who added comments to provide feedback. The annotations were investigated through questionnaires and interviews that were analysed for their depth of reflection and participants' views about the video reflection process. Results indicate that the video process only marginally supported the provision of targeted feedback and pre-service teacher reflection. Factors which contributed to these outcomes are discussed.},

We encountered the former challenge in September 2020, during a faculty Zoom meeting. Our Zoom erasure experience and subsequent Twitter crop experience raised questions for our investigation: why do people of colour experience erasure on zoom and other digital platforms? Is this problem new? What are the outcomes of our experience? How could the problem be fixed? How is it that biases in technology seem to emulate those found in social life? In this paper we aim to raise awareness through sharing our experience and recommending the interrogation of algorithmic tools released for market, the creation of government policy and laws to hold software companies accountable, and the education about biases for IT professionals, educators, and students in the field.},

This strategy promotes student-student interaction and helps break the social isolation of distance learning. Given the concern by Arum and Roksa (2011) that student-student interaction may be distracting from instead of contributing to academic achievement it was felt important to examine the way peer interaction can contribute to learning in a well-structured collaborative learning activity. This mixed-methods study (n=31) examined both quantitative and qualitative aspects of student perceptions of the study buddy activity. While quantitative findings regarding depth of processing were inconclusive due to the small and homogeneous sample, qualitative analysis showed very high levels of learner support for the activity as well as evidence that the activity encouraged learners to approach their learning with greater depth. 88\% of study buddies said they found the activity well worth their time, and would recommend it for other graduate courses. It is thought with greater scaffolding, the quality of buddy feedback might be improved. The few who did not appreciate the activity felt let down by a lack of buddy commitment to the process.},

This combination of factors, harms all learners, and harms students who have darker skin colour, or are neuro-divergent much more significantly than others.   This review of the literature on assessment in higher education shows that there are significant problems associated with this reliance of summative assessments and that encouraging a move towards more formative, human-centred assessment models will require sustained and pan-institutional effort to change deeply rooted ways of thinking about teaching, learning, and assessment.},

Responses were interpreted taking into account the influence of governance narratives on the development of boardism, i.e., a decrease of academic self-governance reflecting the decline of the power of teaching staff in HEIs' governance; an increase of managerial governance as reflected in the reinforcement of hierarchies and organisational top-down decision-making; and the influence of external stakeholders. The analysis contributes to dig into the complexity of the governance arrangements challenging the prevailing influence of the NPM governance narrative while underlining the internal dynamics of HEIs, where Portuguese teaching staff continue to play a key role.},

We focused in a nuanced way on innovative opportunities and practices of feedback in the digital age. The data collected from the semi-structured interviews revealed that participants understood the value of quality formative assessment and feedback. Most participants reacted negatively to assessment grids and feedback received from lecturers. Some were unaccustomed to digital formative assessment and feedback as a developmental tool. They recommended a discipline-specific blended feedback approach that incorporates face-to-face feedback to make the digital feedback provided to them more meaningful. This would provide useful feedback that would create a customised and personalised learning experience for students in collaborative knowledge-building.},

This research proposes a theoretical model which can be integrated into three motivational theories: ARCS, McClelland's needs, and Self-Determinant Theory (SDT). The construct indicators were developed and then validated empirically at two universities in Makassar, Indonesia. A quantitative method with survey approach was used. The research sample consisted of 71 lecturers and 210 students selected purposively. The analysis of measurement models used partial least square (PLS). The results show that the construct of motivation with indicators that built it met validity and reliability requirements.

This paper reports a multiple case study that aimed to bridge this gap and explore online formative assessment (FA) and feedback practices of three ESL teachers working in three universities in India, Bangladesh and Nepal. Data were collected through classroom observations, interviews and document analysis. The results indicate that all three teachers actively engaged their students in a variety of FA practices, although they did not use the obtained information from assessments properly and there remained many areas of improvement. Their feedback practices, which involved the~integration of a few digital tools, were regular and student-friendly. The study is significant in that it is the~first of its kind.

The second aim is to investigate how giving of face to face feedback by teachers can have an influence on students writing performance. To this end, ESL Writing Grading Rubric was used in the teaching of writing skill to the preparatory school students (n=36) to help them understand the targets for their learning and the standards of quality for writing skills in order to improve their writing performance. Also, face to face feedback was given to the writing assignments of students to promote the students' awareness about their writing drawbacks. The qualitative analysis of the findings based on the open-ended questionnaire and focused group interview showed that using rubrics in teaching writing skill and also giving face to face feedback improved the students writing performance. Students reported that by gaining awareness about the rubric, they could check their writing work, give feedback to their peers' work, produce high-quality writings, and got better grades.},

  abstract = {Computer-assisted formative assessments with multiple-tier items are a valid instrument for diagnosing students' conceptual understanding in learning domains with well structured declarative knowledge (e.g. science education). However, it is unknown how feedback on multiple-tier items can improve learning success. Therefore, we assessed (1) predictors of students' perception and use of elaborated feedback, and (2) if feedback content (elaborated, verification, control) matters in explaining students' achievement in post- and retention tests. We developed computer-assisted formative tests for a teaching unit on evolutionary adaptations. Three treatment groups were employed with varying feedback content: Treatment 1 (T1) was an elaborated instruction-based feedback, T2 was a dichotomous verification feedback, and T3 (control) consisted of reading appropriate texts (no formative assessment and no feedback). Afterwards, T1 was separated into one subgroup with pupils who used the feedback thoroughly (T1A) and a subgroup that did not use the feedback (T1B). Ten secondary classrooms were used and 261 pupils participated in this study. Each student in each classroom was randomly assigned to one treatment group. Correlation and univariate regression analysis showed that perception and use of elaborated feedback were related to intrinsic motivation and self-reported grades. Multivariate analysis of covariance was applied to check treatment effects on post-tests and retention tests as dependent variables. Results revealed that verification feedback (T2) and elaborated feedback when students did use it (T1A) was superior to no feedback (T3) and elaborated feedback when students did not use it (T1B). Implications for the design of multiple-tier diagnostic assessments are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Transferring from a predominantly American Indian institution, the participants showed a lack of interest in interacting with non-native faculty, staff, and students and faced ignorance and stereotypes not present at TCUs. This paper has important implications for future research, theory, and practice related to the successful transition of American Indian students from TCUs to PWIs.}

The 20-item Revised Biggs Two-Factor Study Process Questionnaire was used to assess medical students enrolled from the first to the final year of their studies. Data was analysed using SPSS 20. The reliability of the questionnaire was assessed by Cronbach's alpha, and confirmatory factor analysis was done to confirm the factor model. RESULTS: Of the 480 students approached, 284(59.2\%) completed the questionnaire. Cronbach's alpha value was found acceptable at 0.79 and 0.72 for the deep approach and surface approach scales respectively. Comparative Fit Index value (0.858) confirmed a good fit for the model. CONCLUSIONS: Revised Biggs Two-Factor Study Process Questionnaire was found to be a reliable and valid instrument to measure learning approaches among medical students.},

In this article, we present findings from a review of 103 peer-reviewed scientific studies published over the last decade (2007--2017) that address the use of Twitter for educational purposes across formal and informal settings. The majority of the studies reported in the literature are descriptive case studies carried out with students in North American and European higher education settings. Analysis of these studies signals Twitter as a useful tool for communication due to high accessibility, novelty, and real-time format. Students, teachers, and other stakeholders use it as a pedagogical tool to gain information, interact and engage with each other, participate in their respective communities of interests, and share their insights about specific topics. Moreover, Twitter has the potential to enhance students' learning capabilities as well as improve their motivation and engagement due to its unique features and non-traditional teaching approach. Finally, our analysis advocates for carrying out further empirical studies focusing on digital trace data and inference, particularly in the developing countries.},

It is argued that digital storytelling can be integrated as part of the assessment in graduate-level courses without compromising expectations related to academic rigor. Rather, digital storytelling advances multimedia literacy for the individual and supports the generation of bounded learning communities, specifically in online and blended programmes. Covering social presence, teaching presence and cognitive presence, the chapter draws on two examples of digital storytelling used in the MA in Conflict Analysis and Management and the MA in Global Leadership at Royal Roads University, Canada. Overall, the chapter makes a contribution to the conversation of how assessment formats can be updated to match the shift from traditional, lecture formats and brick-and-mortar institutions to applied, collaborative programmes that are often delivered in blended and online formats. Thus, as the field of higher education continues to evolve and adapt alongside technological innovations, the chapter suggests that digital storytelling can be one way to complement and update assessment formats to match the evolution of the twenty-first century.},

Twenty-three analyses, from 20 studies, with a total of 1935 graders, met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. All studies involved graders being exposed to a specific type of information about a student other than the student's performance on a task. The hypothesized biasing characteristics included different race/ethnic backgrounds, education-related deficiencies, physical unattractiveness and poor quality of prior performance. The statistically significant overall between-groups effect size was g\,=\,0.36. Moderator analyses showed no significant difference in effect size related to whether the work graded was from a primary school student or a university student. No one type of biasing characteristic showed a significantly higher effect size than other types. The results suggest that bias can occur in subjective grading when graders are aware of irrelevant information about the students.},

In this article, I retell the process of my inquiry in moving from field texts (data sources) to research text (interpretation of experience) in Narrative Inquiry. I draw from an inquiry on how nurses experience living their values amidst organizational change to share how I as an inquirer/researcher, moved from field texts to narrative accounts; narrative resonant threads; composite letter as the narrative of experience; personal, practical, and social justifications to construct the research text and represent it another form as a poem. These phases in the inquiry involve considerations in the analytic and interpretive process that are essential in understanding how to conduct Narrative Inquiry. Lastly and unique to my inquiry, I share how a letter can be used as an analytic device in Narrative Inquiry.}

The study was conducted in two countries, the Lithuanian University of Health Science (LUHS) and Pennsylvania State University (PSU) in the US, between 1 January and 30 June 2020. A total of 92 students (60 from LUHS and 32 from PSU) were trained in endotracheal intubation using an algorithm-driven hybrid learning method. At the end of the training session, the participants had to complete the evaluation scenario, which was assessed by one of the students and evaluated remotely by a single teacher. The student assessment of the endotracheal intubation procedure was compared with the teacher's assessment using correlation and estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient.ResultsOverall, the medians of the student and teacher assessments were both 100\% (0\%). Spearman's correlation coefficient between the student and teacher assessments was 0.879 (p = 0.001). The intraclass correlation coefficient used for interobserver variations between the students and teacher was 0.883 (95\% confidence interval from 0.824 to 0.923).ConclusionsThe algorithm-driven hybrid learning method allows students to reliably assess endotracheal intubation skills to a level comparable with that of the teacher's evaluation. This learning method has the potential to be a cost-effective and efficient way to provide high-quality education while also saving human resources.},

This study delves into the experiences of students and facilitators engaged in synchronous and asynchronous online dialogic discussions and e-facilitation to enhance our understanding of NoS. An innovative experiment employed a digital dialogue game to engage postgraduate students in a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) secondary science course. The participants included sixty-five PGCE science students and three lecturers specializing in different science disciplines (Physics, Chemistry, and Biology). Qualitative data collection methods and analysis, including transcripts of online discussions about NoS topics, were followed by critical event recall interviews to identify specific online dialogue events that significantly contributed to the comprehension of NoS.~The findings contribute significantly to comprehending students' processes in grasping complex and debatable topics such as Nature of Science (NoS) within online dialogic discussions supported by e-facilitation. They emphasize the importance of establishing an open and expansive dialogic space, with a focus on the crucial roles of e-facilitators. The results also highlight a tension between active and passive roles in both synchronous and asynchronous online discussions. Additionally, the study sheds light on the influence of space, time, and texts in understanding NoS through e-facilitated online dialogic discussions. Notably, the research emphasizes the live chat room's significance within Interloc, accentuating its role as a social space fostering a sense of community and a safe environment for inquiry in online dialogue which supported understanding NoS.},

Regular assessment of these programmes is essential in order to take actions to improve their quality. The said assessment should be complex and include all of the components of the programme, as well as its planning and implementation stages and its effects. The purpose of this paper is to present a model designed to assess the quality of online Higher Education online programmes that includes the assessment of the quality of the programme itself, as well as its continuous assessment. In order to design the model, the author conducted a bibliographical analysis of different standards, models, and guides developed in Spain and other countries to assess online education. The model was validated by 23 international online education experts. The results of the validation were triangulated with specialized literature, thus allowing the author to make decisions regarding whether to change the model by keeping, reformulating, or removing a dimension or indicator. As a result, two variables, fourteen dimensions, and 81 indicators were obtained. In order to verify the utility of the model it was applied in the assessment of four online programmes. The model guides the persons in charge of the implementation of online programmes and allows to conduct a more comprehensive assessment of the programme in order to discover its strengths and weaknesses, and opportunities for its improvement. The model can be also applied by online programme designers as a guideline for creating other, high quality programmes.},

There is a lack of indicators to help assess the quality of three key types of didactic materials commonly used in online education: didactic units (i.e., materials that contain program contents), didactic guides (i.e., materials that provide information), and additional didactic materials (materials to deepen knowledge). The objective of this article is to present a system of indicators designed to assess the quality of these types of didactic materials and guide their creation process. The system was developed based on a critical analysis of existing models designed to assess the quality of digital didactic materials. The system was validated by 16 international experts in online education, and a trial application of the system assessed five didactic guides and didactic units used by online universities in three different countries. Results of the validation process were triangulated with relevant literature, allowing the authors to make decisions regarding changes to the system in terms of maintaining, reformulating, or removing indicators. The resulting system comprises 43 assessment indicators and serves as a guide for designers, teachers, and users in the creation and selection of didactic materials for use in online education and in the assessment of their quality.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of AI in many aspects of human life---from personal leisure, to collaborative professional work, to global policy decisions---poses a sharp question about how to prepare people for an interconnected, fast-changing world which is increasingly becoming saturated with technological devices and agentic machines. What kinds of capabilities do people need in a world infused with AI? How can we conceptualise these capabilities? How can we help learners develop them? How can we empirically study and assess their development? With this paper, we open the discussion by adopting a dialogical knowledge-making approach. Our team of 11 co-authors participated in an orchestrated written discussion. Engaging in a semi-independent and semi-joint written polylogue, we assembled a pool of ideas of what these capabilities are and how learners could be helped to develop them. Simultaneously, we discussed conceptual and methodological ideas that would enable us to test and refine our hypothetical views. In synthesising these ideas, we propose that there is a need to move beyond AI-centred views of capabilities and consider the ecology of technology, cognition, social interaction, and values.},

Sixty-five graduates of a K-12 school leadership preparation program from a large public university in New York State were included in this study. A survey was used to collect school leadership program graduates' scores on the New York State School Building Leader (SBL) and School District Leader (SDL) licensure assessments as well as their perceptions of their coursework and internship training in the Interstate School Leader Licensure Consortium (ISLLC) Standards. The results of this study showed no statistically significant differences on scores for SBL Part I, SBL Part II and the SDL Part I licensure assessments among the face-to-face and online groups. However, there were statistically significant differences for SDL Part II scores. The mean scores showed the online instructional program graduates scoring higher on the dimensions of Leading District Educational Programs and Managing District Resources and Compliance. There were little to no statistically significant differences found on the coursework preparation for the ISLLC Standards among the face-to-face and online program graduates. On internship preparation, there were statistically significant differences on ISLLC Standard Three: management of the organization, operations, and resources for a safe, efficient learning environment. Here, online graduates perceived better preparedness than face-to-face graduates. The implications of this research suggested that online school leadership preparation programs can be as effective as face-to-face programs.},

Three models were evaluated which included a one-factor model, five-factor model, and higher-order model. The five-factor and higher-order models aligned with the development of the OCDE. The frequency of use of OCDE items was rated above the mean 4.0 except for two items on collaboration and self-assessment. The overall OCDE score was related to self-reported levels of expertise but not with years of experience. The findings have implications for the use of this instrument with online instructors and instructional designers in the design of online courses.},

It combines mixed techniques that are used on four sources: (1) External practice guides and dissertations (TFM) from 37 Spanish Faculties of Education; (2) interviews with a sample of 7 Master coordinators; (3) A survey on 94 university tutors from the above-mentioned universities, in charge of trainee teachers' external practice and dissertations (TFM); and (4) Interviews with 46 school tutors from practice schools. Results show the persistence of different situations and a lack of definition in the guidelines as well as in some teachers' perceptions that have more to do with educational models of the past. Among other aspects to improve, this degree shows a marginal use of ICT during Practicum and Dissertation phases, also a lack of assessment criteria in the guides regarding portfolios, theory/practice coordination, tutorship or prevention of plagiarism is observed in most of the studied cases.},

However, a clear delineation between the host of individual leadership theories does not exist. Absent is a nuanced view of the similarities, differences, and any overlap between the various leadership theories. Without a clear understanding of the relationships between leadership theories, knowing when to apply which theories and when becomes difficult. Solution: A systematic review of the literature surrounding servant leadership (SL) through 2022 was conducted to position SL among the more extensively researched transactional and transformational leadership theories. This article outlines the histories of the three theories, focusing on the characteristics, pervasiveness, antecedents, outcomes, and measurement of SL to distinguishing it from transactional and transformational leadership.; Stakeholders: Human resource development, human resource management, and organizational behavior scholars, practitioners, educators, and students. In addition, organizational leaders responsible for setting the organization's vision and practitioners responsible for designing leadership development programs will benefit from this article.

This study explores the perspective of all the lecturers at a Portuguese private higher education institution who were invited to participate, regardless of their research area, in this questionnaire. It aims to propose and test a conceptual model that combines attitudes, preferred activities, and technological experience with the sentiment about the impact of this experience on students' learning process, on their teaching activity, and on the strategy of higher education institutions. An online questionnaire was conducted to 65 lecturers engaging in emergency online lecturing. The obtained results showed that lecturers reveal a positive attitude towards online lecturing, tend to prefer activities in which they feel most comfortable in face-to-face lecturing, and consider having technological experience useful for online activities. Lecturers have a positive sentiment about the impact of online learning on students' learning, their faculty career, and the strategy of higher education institutions. The proposed conceptual model test shows that the model has well-fitting conditions. The results confirm the hypotheses formulated: namely, the predictive effect of attitude, preferred activities, and technological experience on sentiment. Faculty engagement in emergency online lecturing shows that the members are available to participate in the changing process, and the proposed conceptual model can be used to assess this readiness.},

Recently, student behaviors in online social networks have been extensively examined. However, limited efforts have been made to evaluate and systematically review the current research status to provide insights into previous study findings. Accordingly, this study conducted a systematic literature review on student behavior and OSNs to explicate to what extent students behave on these platforms. This study reviewed 104 studies to discuss the research focus and examine trends along with the important theories and research methods utilized. Moreover, the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) model was utilized to classify the factors that influence student behavior. This study's results demonstrate that the number of studies that address student behaviors on OSNs have recently increased. Moreover, the identified studies focused on five research streams, including academic purpose, cyber victimization, addiction, personality issues, and knowledge sharing behaviors. Most of these studies focused on the use and effect of OSNs on student academic performance. Most importantly, the proposed study framework provides a theoretical basis for further research in this context.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, the key principle of assessment was based on the depth and intensity of the knowledge taught in class. In our modern state, the notion of assessment is more about learning and less about whether it is deep or surface learning. This could be attributed to challenges facing higher education, such as marketisation, massification, access and success. This article aims to demonstrate the significance of assessment as a pedagogical and measuring tool to promote deep learning in institutions of higher learning. It analyses how different types of assessment could contribute to deep learning while enhancing critical thinking and analytical skills. The article adopted the qualitative research approach to appraise critically and examine the literature on assessment in higher education. The sequence in which assessment tasks are presented, the pedagogical approaches adopted and measurement tools used should aim to present general non-threatening questions. The article recognises Bloom's taxonomy as it classifies educational learning objectives in the manner that accommodates deep learning. This article suggests that assessment should be made explicit, aligned with learning outcomes that consider deep learning in terms of acquisition of knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and understanding of basic concepts in what is learnt. It concludes that students need to be engaged in their assessment to enable them to develop skills and dispositions that prepare them for the future as socially responsible citizens. Research needs to be conducted on the higher education challenges that compromise the quality of assessment as this could have negative effects on the development of deep learning.},

A web-based prototype software was then developed that implements the framework along with the assessment method and the 20 top features. To determine the validity of the main feature of CIMS (i.e., the assessment method), sample forum data consisting of 28 threads with a total of more than 1000 messages spanning various topic domains was collected from the Slashdot forum and the numeric ratings assigned to messages in this data was used to measure accuracy and reliability of the numeric ratings assigned by CIMS by analyzing it using Cohen's Kappa.

  abstract = {Over the last few decades, not only organizations but also Higher Education Institutions should be more responsive to the demands of the changed global business environment and improve their effectiveness. Our motivation to write this paper is to assess the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in higher education and their associated benefits, with a focus on students' performance when applying an SAP solution. This paper analyses the accuracy of undergraduate students, focusing primarily on the concept of self-assessment as they predict and evaluate their own performance relative to their externally assessed achievement. In the pre- and post-examination predictions the higher achieving students seem to predict and evaluate their examination results more accurately than their lower-achieving fellows. Although a gender gap cannot be found in self-estimation, we found substantial differences by comparing the selected language. Foreign students seem to overestimate their own examination performance to a greater degree than Hungarians do. Consequently, our results might allow decision makers to identify why self-assessment is important when implementing pilot ERP projects. The result of this study also provide evidence for groups of clients and other stakeholders in order to reduce failure in both higher education and business environment.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the study was to examine the experiences of current high school students, teachers, and high school graduates in Ontario regarding their experiences with personal financial curriculum and teaching at the secondary level, and to identify the ways in which this important educational experience may have helped prepare students to become financially literate. I sought to examine how helpful and productive financial literacy teaching and curriculum were at preparing students to confidently address personal financial issues they would inevitably face. I considered this overarching issue using a transdisciplinary lens from the perspective of the three stakeholder groups. Using a case study research design, the first of its kind in Ontario or Canada on this topic, I utilized interviews, artifacts, and surveys to uncover student and teacher experiential data across three high schools and two institutions of higher learning in southeastern Ontario. For the interviews and artifacts, there were 12 students and 12 teachers from three high schools. For the high school graduate surveys, there were 344 participants, drawn from one college and one university. Inductive thematic analysis was used for the interviews and artifacts; descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were used for the surveys, with some significance testing. The major findings were that current students and high school graduates perceived curriculum and teaching experiences as seriously lacking in effectively preparing them to be financially literate, and that a fundamental reorientation around transdisciplinary, student-led learning was key to transforming such learning into a more meaningful and valuable educational experience. The central finding from the teacher perspective was that such instruction should be mandated, properly supported and largely student-led; reaffirming the view that greater student learning, meaning and value were achievable with suitable enactment. Accordingly, the three stakeholder groups shared the view that curriculum and teaching in the area of personal financial literacy was largely absent and/or ineffective at meeting student interests and needs. With mandatory, properly supported, student-oriented (transdisciplinary) instruction, the potential exists for more effective and valuable learning, resulting in better equipped high school students that were properly prepared to successfully navigate financial issues and the path ahead.},

It clarifies what 'use of data' means and differentiates the different levels of decision-making in education (relating to the system, district, school, classroom, or individual student). The relationship between data and decision-making is considered and various movements in the use of data to improve student learning are analysed, especially from the perspective of their assumptions and effects. This leads to a focus on effective educational decision-making as a social process requiring collaboration among all relevant participants. It also requires a clear understanding of educational aims, and these are seen to transcend what can be assessed by standardised tests. The consequences of this analysis for decision processes are explored and conclusions are drawn about what principles might best guide educational practice as well as what ambiguities remain. Throughout, the focus is on what existing research says about each of the issues explored. .},

The inherent mental habits of media multitasking---dividing attention, switching attention, and maintaining multiple trains of thought--- have significant implications and consequences for students' academic performance. The goal of this review is to synthesize research on the impacts of media multitasking on academic performance. The research indicates that media multitasking interferes with attention and working memory, negatively affecting GPA, test performance, recall, reading comprehension, note-taking, self-regulation, and efficiency. These effects have been demonstrated during in- class activities (largely lectures) and while students are studying. In addition, students struggle to accurately assess the impact media multitasking will have on their academic performance. Further research should attend to understanding effects of media multitasking in more diverse instructional contexts and for varied academic tasks. Fostering students' self-regulation around media multitasking is a promising area for future efforts towards improving academic performance of college students.},

On retention tests, the control group performed more poorly than each of the other groups, which did not differ from one another. On problem-solving tests, the concurrent group performed better than each of the other groups, which did not differ from one another. These results are consistent with a dual-coding model in which retention requires the construction of representational connections and problem solving requires the construction of representational and referential connections. An instructional implication is that pictures and words are most effective when they occur contiguously in time or space. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)},

Second, based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, we examine the concept of cognitive overload in which the learner's intended cognitive processing exceeds the learner's available cognitive capacity. Third, we examine five overload scenarios. For each overload scenario, we offer one or two theory-based suggestions for reducing cognitive load, and we summarize our research results aimed at testing the effectiveness of each suggestion. Overall, our analysis shows that cognitive load is a central consideration in the design of multimedia instruction.}

By regulating students' progress through the program based on their mastery of tightly defined competencies rather than on the time spent learning them, this learning environment affords students far greater flexibility than traditional programs. This focus on defined competencies has led to concerns that students in these types of programs may not demonstrate higher level skills, such as critical thinking, at levels comparable to those enrolled in more traditional programs. This study evaluated 39 students' demonstration of critical thinking in two assessments administered in parallel versions of one course: one offered through the nonterm, direct assessment CBE University of Wisconsin Flexible Option, and the other offered through a traditional online program. For this study, each of the 78 assessments was scored using the critical thinking rubric from the Valid Assessment of Learning in Undergraduate Education (VALUE) project. We found that students from the CBE version of the course received significantly higher (p = 0.0013) overall scores than the students in the traditional online version of the course. While further research is required to refine these methods and ensure the generalizability of these results, they do not support concerns about students' abilities in this learning environment.},

This transition is predominantly driven by the need to improve the student assessment experience, but some institutions now also cite the need to improve the staff assessment experience. Existing studies, however, provide seemingly contradictory evidence surrounding this online marking experience. This article adopts a mixed methods approach to explore academic staff preferences of the assessment experience within a UK-based institution following adoption of online submission, feedback and grading during 2017--2018. It finds that although the majority of colleagues prefer to mark and provide feedback online, the process of marking electronically is highly individual. Online marking is not just a single practice but a set of varied, rich approaches, influenced by individual marker perceptions, preferences and previous experiences, and is often highly emotive. Changes to existing marking practices are seen simultaneously as both challenging and liberating by cohorts of markers. Drawing on the results of a detailed staff survey, this article identifies seven themes that are influential to that experience. These findings have significant implications for how institutions manage change to large-scale adoption of online marking.},

In order to consider these silences as purposeful strategic moves on the part of research participants, I propose a problematic of silence that allows the silences to breathe and speak. This problematic of silence attempts to interrupt fixed notions of what counts as text and speech in our researching of the social and seeks to engage the limits of research in order to allow the spoken silences to be present in the textual records of educational action research.},

It takes inspiration from work on assessment for learning to propose that as assessment is a powerful driver of how and what students learn, we should also consider its potential to drive a commitment for greater social justice within and through higher education. The article provides a critique of procedural notions of social justice, which I argue have implicitly influenced current notions of fairness in assessment. Greater reflection on the possible flaws in such procedural notions is a starting point for rethinking assessment in social justice terms. I then draw on two alternative conceptualisations of social justice -- the capabilities approach and critical theory -- to consider the ways in which key assessment issues would look differently through these alternative lenses. The article does not aim to establish a prescriptive list of practices around the notion of assessment for social justice, but rather upon debate and a greater appreciation of the implications of how we conceptualise justice and the attendant influence on what may be considered appropriate assessment policies and practices.},

I consider the origins of the term in the US schooling sector, and how it has developed over time, and in different countries, to today focus in higher education largely on real world tasks. There is, however, I argue, a common conflation of real world with the world of work. Little of this literature actually engages with the rich philosophical debates on authenticity, and in this article, I suggest that this deeper understanding of authenticity can enable us to build on existing work on authentic assessment to develop a more holistic and richer concept that will be more beneficial to individual students and to the larger society of which they are part. I argue that we should move from thinking in terms of either the so-called real world, or the world of work, to focus our justification for authentic assessment on its social value (which encompasses but is not limited to its economic value). To achieve this aim, I suggest we move from simply focusing on the authentic task to considering why that task matters? This then enables a shift from the student in isolation to the student as a member of society. Senses of achievement can become richer, thus enhancing the students' sense of self, self-worth, and well-being.},

[.]compared to non-Inuit educators, Inuit are more likely to find that family and community obligations make it difficult for them to take graduate programs at universities in the south.;Offered between 2006 and 2009 and graduating 21 Inuit candidates, the Nunavut Master of Education program was a collaborative effort made to address the erosion of Inuit leadership in the K-12 school system after the creation of Nunavut, Canada's newest territory, in 1999. Delivered to a large extent in short, intensive, face-to-face courses, the program also made extensive use of online supports. This paper outlines the design challenges -- geographical, technological, pedagogical, and cultural -- that faced the development and delivery of the online portion of the program. It highlights the intersection of the design decisions with the decolonizing principles that framed the program as a whole, the various and varying roles played by the online environment over the course of the program, and the program's contribution to student success.;},

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the experiences of tertiary students learning oral presentation skills in a range of online and blended learning contexts across diverse disciplines. Design/methodology/approach: The research was designed as a "federation" of trials of diverse online oral communications assessment tasks (OOCATs). Tasks were set in ten courses offered across all five faculties at University of Newcastle, Australia. The authors collected and analysed data about students' experiences of tasks they completed through an anonymous online survey. Findings: Students' engagement with the task was extremely positive but also highly varied. This diversity of student experience can inform teaching, and in doing so, can support student equity. By understanding what students think hinders or facilitates their learning, and which students have these experiences, instructors are able to make adjustments to their teaching which address both real and perceived issues. Student experience in this study highlighted five very clear themes in relation to the student experience of undertaking online oral communications tasks which all benefit from nuanced responses by the instructor: relevance; capacity; technology; time; and support. Practical implications: Using well-designed OOCATs that diverge from more traditional written assessments can help students successfully engage with course content and develop oral communication skills. The student experience can be used to inform teaching by catering for different student learning styles and experience. Student centred approaches such as this allows instructors to reflect upon the assumptions they hold about their students and how they learn. This understanding can help inform adjustments to teaching approaches to support improved student experience of learning oral communications tasks. Originality/value: The importance of learning oral communication skills in tertiary education is widely acknowledged internationally, however, there is limited research on how to teach these skills online in a way that is student centred. This research makes a contribution toward addressing that gap.},

University supervisors have a range of knowledge and experience in implementing performance-based feedback and using technology to deliver feedback. The purpose of this article is to describe how university supervisors can deliver technology-enhanced performance-based feedback to support teacher candidates' use of evidence-based practices within authentic education environments. Specifically, we identify different modes of technology, which university supervisors can use to deliver performance-based feedback (e.g., email, text messaging, bug-in-ear, and video-based feedback). Additionally, we include logistical and practical suggestions for university supervisors to consider when implementing technology-enhanced performance-based feedback to support teacher candidates during field placements.},

  abstract = {This article provides a description and analysis of the way in which research degree students and their supervisors at one Australian university (the University of South Australia) use a popular online plagiarism-detection system, iThenticate. The study identifies how these two groups use iThenticate by analysing usage data together with data from an anonymous online survey conducted 12 months after the university took out a pilot subscription to the system. One hundred and nineteen students and 26 supervisors responded to the survey, representing 61\% and 43\% of the active users in each category. The survey found that the two groups of respondents used the system differently but that, while for both groups iThenticate's regulatory function in preventing plagiarism (whether international or accidental) was important, the system's potential educational function in improving research writing capability and publication was equally important. The study highlights the value of regarding the use of anti-plagiarism software so as to encourage a move way from a simple focus on its punitive regulatory dimension and towards its educational possibilities and suggests directions for future research on the relationship between this type of software and the ways scholars work with other people's texts to recreate meanings and develop original contributions.  Implications for practice or policy:    Online plagiarism detection systems (such as iThenticate) can be used either negatively to police doctoral students' practice or positively to improve their research writing practice.  Academic developers should promote a positive approach, aimed at improving research writing practice, as the preferable pedagogy in using online plagiarism-detection systems.},

This has prompted a shift to online modes of teaching and assessment, with varying degrees of success and possibly much discomfort. In this communication, reflections and comments on the results of asynchronous online assessment of physical chemistry courses at the Cave Hill campus of the University of the West Indies are presented.

Some scholars, however, suggest that a continued focus on how these young people are marginalised is itself a problem, and that research should also focus on strengths and what is working. The purpose of this paper is to examine the activities of a group of LGBTQ students in one school in Auckland, New Zealand. Design/methodology/approach -- The study employed a critical ethnographic approach in a diverse co-educational, public high school in Auckland, New Zealand. The researcher spent 3-5 days per week at the school throughout three terms (32 weeks) of the 2016 school year and participated, observed and interviewed students and teachers. Post-structural theory was used to analyse the ethnographic materials. Findings -- The study found that LGBTQ students actively challenged the heteronorms of their school. They met regularly to discuss issues, support each other and to plan activist initiatives. These initiatives, in turn, impacted the environment of the school and made LGBTQ students more visible. This visibility, however, also created tensions as students grappled with their identities and the public space of school. Originality/value -- Despite a wealth of research in education on the exclusion of young people at the intersection of gender, sexuality and other identity positions, there is very little research that reports on school-wide health promotion initiatives that both engage young people as leaders and participants in their schools, and work towards creating safe and empowering spaces for LGBTQ youth.},

One approach is to have students cultivate a concept, awareness, and practice of an ethnographic sensibility, that is, of a sense of the ethnographic as the lived expectations, complexities, contradictions, possibilities, and ground of any given cultural group. Such a view opens up an understanding of ethnography and ethnographic research as more than available qualitative methods. Instead, it takes an ethnographic approach to be an epistemological one. Yet, how might we do this? In this article, I discuss my pedagogical strategies for teaching students an ethnographic sensibility without having them conduct fieldwork. I argue that it is both possible and valuable to generate an ethnographic sensibility in the classroom.},

Peer assessment (PA) has the potential to develop the evaluative competence of students in HE. In the Republic of Ireland (RoI) there are three Institutes that each deliver a professionally validated honours degree programme in Medical/Biomedical Science. The aim of this paper is to report on the experiences and views of the academic staff involved in these three programmes with respect to assessment. Presented here is one aspect of a larger study into assessment practices in the education of Irish Medical Scientists with the overall aim being the development of a framework for the structured inclusion of PA. An insight into the current practices, experiences and views of staff is an essential step in the development of an effective framework. All academic staff (n=80) involved in the three programmes were invited to complete an online anonymous survey. Employing a mixed methods design, the survey incorporated closed questions e.g. subject area, years of experience and formal teaching qualifications, and open questions including staff's understanding of the terminology of assessment, if they use PA, their reasons for choosing PA and any challenges they may have encountered. Thirty-five staff responded to the survey; all three institutes were represented. The thematic analysis of the qualitative data demonstrated that staff generally see assessment as a 'measure' (grade or mark) of understanding and knowledge. The distinction between formative and summative assessment was not clear for all staff; 19/33 staff described summative assessment as an 'end of module' exam and 13/33 staff referred to formative assessment as being 'continuous' or 'ongoing'. There was clear evidence of a lack of use of terms associated with assessment; such as 'assessment as, of and for learning'. Eleven of the respondents use PA in their module(s), they reported the positives and challenges of PA as they experienced e.g. increased student engagement, importance of student preparation. The results of this study confirm the need for, and provides a justification of, building a best practice framework for PA in HE Medical Science education in RoI.},

PeerWise is an online software tool that engages students in contributing to their own and others' learning by authoring, answering and providing feedback on multiple choice questions. Using a mixed methods approach, 20 students responded to discussion questions and an online survey about their perceptions of using PeerWise compared to online quizzes as part of the blended delivery of a postgraduate psychology unit. Students considered both authoring and answering questions in PeerWise to equally benefit their learning. Answering questions in PeerWise was perceived to be more helpful for learning than questions on a Moodle quiz. This advantage was evident across more complex cognitive skills, understanding, applying, evaluating and creating information, although only significant for facilitating understanding. PeerWise and online quizzes were seen to be equally helpful in facilitating recall. Despite the perceived benefits of PeerWise, students preferred quiz questions to be set by an expert if used as recognition of progress. Introducing PeerWise was effective in promoting engagement with peers; however, refinements to the model should focus on increasing student confidence in their own and peers' capabilities.

  abstract = {The purpose of this explanatory mixed methods study was to examine the perceived value of mixed methods research for graduate students. The quantitative phase was an experiment examining the effect of a passage's methodology on students' perceived value. Results indicated students scored the mixed methods passage as more valuable than those who scored the quantitative or qualitative passage. The qualitative phase involved focus groups to better understand students' perceptions of the perceived value of mixed methods. Findings suggested graduate students view mixed methods passages as having rigorous methods, a newer history, and providing a deeper meaning of the phenomenon. This study adds to the literature base by revealing what value graduate students assign to quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research.},

Additionally, we recommend that universities and research institutions articulate expectations about author roles and responsibilities to provide a point of common understanding for discussion of authorship across research teams. Furthermore, we propose that funding agencies adopt the ORCID identifier and accept the CRediT taxonomy. We encourage scientific societies to further authorship transparency by signing on to these recommendations and promoting them through their meetings and publications programs.},

It proposes a categorization of introductory programming challenges, and highlights key issues for a research roadmap on introductory programming learning and teaching in higher education. Background: Despite the advances in methods and tools for teaching and learning introductory programming, dropout and failure rates are still high. Published surveys and reviews either cover papers only up to 2007, or focus on methods and tools for teaching introductory programming. Research Questions: 1) What previous skills and background knowledge are key for a novice student to learn programming? 2) What difficulties do novice students encounter in learning how to program? 3) What challenges do teachers encounter in teaching introductory programming? Methodology: Following a formal protocol, automatic and manual searches were performed for work from 2010 to 2016. Of 100 papers selected for data extraction, 89 were retained after quality assessment. Findings: The most frequently cited skills necessary for learning programming were related to problem solving and mathematical ability. Problem solving was also cited as a learning challenge, followed by motivation and engagement, and difficulties in learning the syntax of programming languages. The main teaching challenges concern the lack of appropriate methods and tools, as well as scaling and personalized teaching.},

One such assumption is that external examiners are assessment literate. This study evaluates levels of assessment literacy demonstrated within the written reports  of external examiners. Findings indicate variable levels of assessment literacy and identify aspects of the concept that require attention. Wider questions concerning the conceptualization and future development of the external examining system are considered.},

The traditional view of schooling as a meritocratic sorting device is contrasted with (1) the view of schooling that asserts schools (either wittingly or unwittingly) serve to reproduce the existing hierarchies of privilege; (2) the point of view that proposes that schools, peers, and families mediate the relations between structural constraints and human action; and (3) a resurgent democratic conception of schooling.In contrast to the meritocratic conception of opportunity to learn (OTL) and assessment that asserts schools provide students with avenues to compete as individuals for valued resources, I present evidence that questions whether students have equal access to valued educational and cultural resources. This leads to defining OTL in terms of establishing the conditions within schools for the open flow of ideas and solving problems that are connected to the ``real world.'' Multiple measures of students' academic performance -- especially those such as portfolios and exhibitions -- that assess learning in authentic contexts (see Gee, this volume, and Mislevy, this volume) are preferred over standardized tests as assessment tools.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, curricula in higher education have increasingly incorporated collaborative learning. However, due to (a) large variations in students' domain-specific abilities (e.g. knowledge and/or skills) and the effort they invest into the collaboration and (b) teachers' limited knowledge about how to assess collaborative learning, two main challenges arise. The first challenge concerns ensuring construct validity of the assessment methods, that is, whether an assessment accurately measures students' domain-specific abilities. The second challenge originates from the potential of assessment methods to elicit student behaviour that is misaligned with the objectives of collaborative learning (e.g. free-riding behaviour). This paper aims to enhance teachers', researchers', and students' awareness for and need to develop what we refer to as 'collaborative learning assessment literacy'. In particular, we will discuss the two challenges in relation to three frequently used and discussed methods for assessing collaborative learning - group assessment, individual assessment, and group assessment combined with intra-group peer assessment - with specific attention to the purpose of assessment (i.e. formative and summative). Implications of the two challenges as well as their relation to other core components in the design of any collaborative learning setting (e.g. group constellation) will be discussed.},

This study set out to investigate higher education teachers' perceptions of the prevalence and types of cheating in their courses with a focus on the possible changes that might come about as a result of an increased use of e-assessment, ways of addressing cheating, and how the use of student authentication and authorship checking systems might impact on assessment practice. This study was carried out within the context of the project TeSLA (an Adaptive Trust-based e-assessment System for Learning) which is developing a system intended for integration within an institution's Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) offering a variety of instruments to assure student authentication and authorship checking. Data was collected at two universities that were trialling the TeSLA system, one in Turkey, where the main modes of teaching are face-to-face teaching and distance education, and one in Bulgaria, where the main modes of teaching are face-to-face teaching and blended learning. The study used questionnaires and interviews, building on existing TeSLA project evaluation activities and extending these to explore the specific areas we wished to examine in more depth. In three of the four contexts cheating was seen by teachers as a serious and growing problem, the exception was the distance education context where the teachers believed that the existing procedures were effective in controlling cheating. Most teachers in all four contexts expected cheating to become a greater problem with increased use of e-assessment. Student authentication was not seen as a major problem in any of the contexts, as this was felt to be well controlled through face-to-face proctored assessments, though the problem of assuring effective authentication was seen by many teachers as a barrier to increased use of e-assessment. Authorship checking was seen as a major issue in all contexts, as copying and pasting from the web, ghost writing and plagiarism were all reported as widely prevalent, and authorship checking was seen as becoming even more important with increased use of e-assessment. Teachers identified a third category of cheating behaviours, which was the accessing of information from other students, from written materials, and from the internet during assessments. Teachers identified a number of approaches to addressing the problem of cheating: education, technology, assessment design, sanctions, policy, and surveillance. Whilst technology was not seen as the most important approach to prevention, student authentication and authorship checking systems were seen as relevant in terms of reducing reliance on face-to-face proctored examinations, and in improving the quality of assessment through supporting the employment of a wider range of assessment methods.

Although there is a growing literature assessing the relative efficacy of different online teaching techniques, previous literature has not analyzed, from the student perspective, what methods are preferred for evaluating performance in experiential learning courses. How students perceive assessment methods is critical because it can affect their learning experience and academic achievements. To better understand student preferences for assessment methods, the best-worst scaling approach was used in two online surveys of 218 undergraduate students enrolled in experiential learning-based programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis of student responses indicates students' highest levels of support for assessments that emphasize the development of critical thinking skills and professional skills, such as case studies. Most students would prefer assessments that are driving (develop different skills such as creative thinking) and realistic (develop skills transferable to the real world), while only a few ({$<$} 1\%) prefer assessments that are fast (involve little time), frequent, safe (has preventive measures to eliminate cheating), or strategic (high probability of getting good grades).},

This upheaval has propelled online evaluation and assessment to be the norm during this period. The principal objective of the study and research is to explore students' experience with online emergency learning as well as online evaluation. This paper also investigates how Moroccan English as a foreign language (EFL) university learners perceive online assessment in comparison to face-to-face assessment. Data were collected from a sample of 93 Moroccan EFL university students using a self-designed questionnaire. The findings of this research revealed that the students experienced technical issues while submitting their exams. They have also expressed their disappointment with the lack of feedback provided by their professors, not to mention their constant worry about academic honesty. This has led them to lose interest in their studies and possess doubts about reliving this dissatisfactory experience. Therefore, the results implied that participants perceive online assessment as an insignificant factor for performance improvement. This unprecedented experience has had an unadulterated negative impact on students as it has left them both dissatisfied with their experience regarding distance learning and apprehensive about their future educational experiences. It is, then, recommended that the notion of online assessment should be given much attention in higher education in the Moroccan context.},

The argument is examined and demonstrated that evaluators who are aware of the assumptions that underlie their evaluation choices are able to provide useful support for stakeholders in the examination of the assumptions they hold with regard to the nature of the problem being addressed, the program designed to solve the problem, and the approach to evaluation that is appropriate in that context. Such an informed approach has the potential for development of more appropriate and culturally responsive programs being implemented in ways that lead to the desired impacts, as well as to lead to evaluation approaches that support effective solutions to intransigent social problems. These arguments are illustrated through examples of evaluations from multiple sectors; additional challenges are also identified.},

The transformative paradigm with its associated philosophical assumptions provides a framework for addressing inequality and injustice in society using culturally competent, mixed methods strategies. The recognition that realities are constructed and shaped by social, political, cultural, economic, and racial/ethnic values indicates that power and privilege are important determinants of which reality will be privileged in a research context. Methodological inferences based on the underlying assumptions of the transformative paradigm reveal the potential strength of combining qualitative and quantitative methods. A qualitative dimension is needed to gather community perspectives at each stage of the research process, while a quantitative dimension provides the opportunity to demonstrate outcomes that have credibility for community members and scholars. Transformative mixed methodologies provide a mechanism for addressing the complexities of research in culturally complex settings that can provide a basis for social change.},

  abstract = {Assessing student performance is one of the most critical responsibilities of classroom teachers; yet, many teachers do not feel adequately prepared for this task. Teachers often believe that they need remediation or assistance in applying assessment concepts and techniques, as well as making assessment-related decisions. In an effort to measure teachers' "assessment literacy," an instrument, titled the "Assessment Literacy Inventory (ALI)," was developed and its psychometric properties evaluated. The "ALI" was designed to parallel existing "Standards for Teacher Competence in the Educational Assessment of Students." A two-stage pilot test of the instrument was conducted with 152 preservice teachers in Fall 2003 and 249 preservice teachers in the Spring 2004. Item analyses of the second-stage pilot data revealed an overall instrument reliability (KR20) of 0.74. Individual item analyses (i.e., item difficulties and item discriminations), as well as other indices, were examined. Recommendations for future research include content and construct validation of the "ALI" (both of which are currently being examined), as well as an investigation of the appropriateness of the "ALI" as a measure of inservice teacher assessment literacy. Finally, the "Assessment Literacy Inventory" provides a practical mechanism for educators to measure assessment literacy. Considering the current state of high-stakes accountability in education, the "ALI" could provide school districts an effective, as well as efficient way to allocate resources for developing or otherwise selecting teacher professional development opportunities on the topic of classroom assessment. Appended is: Sample Scenario and Selected Items from the "Assessment Literacy Inventory (ALI)." (Contains 2 tables and 2 figures.)},

This study examined the effectiveness of a two-week classroom assessment workshop for inservice teachers. The workshop was based on the Standards for Teacher Competence in the Educational Assessment of Students and focused on discussion, practice, and practical application through performance assessment tasks. The study utilized a parallel mixed-methods design. Teachers were pre-tested and post-tested using the Assessment Literacy Inventory. Additionally, teachers kept daily reflective journals in order to document their experiences. The training was shown to be highly effective for the teachers, as evidenced through the dramatic increase in post-test scores over pre-test scores, and perhaps even more so through critical examination of their reflective journals.},

  abstract = {Authentic and direct assessments of performances and products are examined in the light of contrasting functions and purposes having implications for validation, especially with respect to the need for specialized validity criteria tailored for performance assessment. These include contrasts between performances and products, between assessment of performance per se and performance assessment of competence or other constructs, between structured and unstructured problems and response modes, and between breadth and depth of domain coverage. These distinctions are elaborated in the context of an overarching contrast between task-driven and construct-driven performance assessment. Rhetoric touting performance assessments because they eschew decomposed skills and decontextualized tasks is viewed as misguided, in that component skills and abstract problems have a legitimate place in pedagogy. Hence, the essence of authentic assessment must be sought elsewhere, that is, in the quest for complete construct representation. With this background, the concepts of ?authenticity? and ?directness? of performance assessment are treated as tantamount to promissory validity claims that they offset, respectively, the two major threats to construct validity, namely, construct underrepresentation and construct-irrelevant variance. With respect to validation, the salient role of both positive and negative consequences is underscored as well as the need, as in all assessment, for evidence of construct validity.},

As action researchers we were determined, indeed even smugly pleased, to be undertaking this venture of tutelage, of introducing the women as co-researchers to methods of data analysis. However, we watched a shifting of power (empowerment), as the women became the true researchers through their proximity to and conversations with the transcripts as raw realities, narratives that acknowledged their lives, which we knew only as data. In the end, we came away unsettled, with deeper awareness for the complexity of interpreting \&\#x2018;data,\&\#x2019; which constitutes local knowing, the unsaid, and the unspeakable.]}

  abstract = {Ten experienced online faculty were interviewed to elicit examples of how they improved student learning productivity in their online courses. The ten faculty represented nine different states, 13 different fields or disciplines, and all were tenured or tenure-track at master's or doctoral level higher education institutions. Based on a thematic analysis of the examples given, improvement in student learning occurred by 1) increasing student access to content, 2) changing the role of faculty (which had two parts: increasing access to and changing faculty roles), 3) increasing interaction with students, 4) emphasizing student effort (including use of experiential learning, group work, learning to learn, and feedback), 5) connecting to the "real world," and 6) focusing on time. These findings suggest that faculty can and do find ways to use different tools in different ways to improve student learning productivity.

They represented nine different states and 13 different fields, and all were tenured or tenure-track at master's or doctoral institutions. All ten mentioned personal motivations for teaching online; eight mentioned professional motivations. Based on analysis of the interviews, several professors felt their teaching productivity had increased as a result of design choices and an increase in workload. Several had freed up time which was spent on service or research although this was modified by the stage of the faculty member's career.},

  abstract = {The onset of the coronavirus pandemic forced schools and universities across the nation and world to close and move to distance learning rather immediately. Almost two years later, colleges and universities have reopened, and most students have returned to campuses, but distance learning still occurs at a much higher rate than before the beginning of the pandemic. A few preliminary studies have shown that online assessment results are similar to in-person assessment results. However, as colleges and universities have expanded their online options, new issues have arisen related to best practices, equity, fairness, test security, and test integrity. Paper-and-pencil assessments should not merely be moved to online assessments without careful consideration to how this administration change affects all students. With the switch to more online assessments, educators and researchers should thoroughly evaluate how to provide these assessments in the most secure, fair, and valid manner while also maintaining the test or assessment's integrity and interpretation.},

While this does require a substantial up-front effort, once prepared assessments can be reproduced with relative ease and with a near-zero probability of students receiving the same question a second time. We show the effectiveness of this approach using survey and performance data obtained from large year 2 and year 3 computer science classes. A greater than 10-fold increase in online peer discussion was observed, compared to the previous year. Contents analysis of the surveys showed that repeat testing was generally regarded favourably. Quantitative analyses found that prior homework did little to improve initial test performance, but was of vital importance in studying for the follow-up isomorphic test. Moreover, the performance gain on the isomorphic questions was the same for all students regardless of their overall ability, and was retained in the final exam.},

  abstract = {Collaboration is a vital skill in today's knowledge economy. Regrettably, many learners lack the regulatory skills required for complex collaborative tasks. In particular, groups struggle to construct shared task perceptions of collaborative tasks on which to launch engagement. Thus, the purpose of this dissertation was to examine how computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) tools can be leveraged to support shared task perceptions for regulating collaboration. Because investigating this process brings forth a wide array of methodological challenges, a second purpose of this dissertation was to explore how CSCL tools can be used as a methodological solution for capturing this process. Towards this end, research unfolded across one conceptual paper and two empirical studies: (a) Miller \& Hadwin (2015a) extended work conceptualizing self-, co-, and shared-regulation in successful collaboration and drew on this theoretical framework to propose ways in which CSCL tools can be designed to support and research regulation of collaboration; (b) Miller, Malmberg, Hadwin, \& J{\"a}rvel{\"a} (2015) investigated the processes that contributed to and constrained groups' construction of shared task perceptions in a CSCL environment in order to inform further refinement of supports; (c) Miller \& Hadwin (2015b) examined the effects of tools providing different levels of individual and group support on construction of shared task perceptions and task performance. Together, findings revealed the potential of blending pedagogical tools to support shared task perceptions with research tools for examining and understanding regulation. In particular, findings evidenced shared task perceptions to be a complex and challenging social phenomenon and shed light on ways in which CSCL tools may prompt and promote this process. In addition, data generated by learners as they interacted with CSCL supports created valuable opportunities to capture shared task perceptions as they unfolded in the context of meaningful collaborative tasks across the individual and group level.},

  abstract = {4chan and reddit are participatory media collectives undergirded by a ``logic of lulz'' that favours distanced irony and critique. It often works at the expense of core identity categories like race and gender. However, the logic need not be entirely counterproductive to public discourse. Provided that diverse identities find voice instead of exclusion, these sites may facilitate vibrant, agonistic discussion instead of disenfranchising antagonism. In order to assess this potential for productive agonism, I undertook a critical discourse analysis of these collectives. Emphasising the image memes they produce, I evaluated discourses on race and gender. Both race and gender representations were dominated by familiar stereotypes and partial representations. However, while dissenting perspectives on race were repressed or excluded, dissenting perspectives on gender were vocalised and contested. The `logic of lulz' facilitated both dominance and counter, each articulated with heavy reliance on irony and critique. This logic ambiguously balanced agonism and antagonism, but contestation provided sharper engagement than repression.},

  abstract = {The paper reports the results of a phenomenographic study on academics' conceptions of e-assessment. A cohort of 21 academics from 17 disciplines participated in semi-structured interviews exploring their experiences of using web-based technologies for formative and summative assessment purposes. Through iterative analysis of the interview transcripts, the study identified four qualitatively different ways in which academic teachers understand e-assessment. It was seen as a means of: (a) efficiently managing and streamlining the assessment process; (b) facilitating dialogue and student engagement; (c) enhancing student learning; and (d) developing (digital) identity and the community. Six interrelated dimensions of variation were also established: the benefit of e-assessment, the role of the assessing teacher, the role of the assessed student, the role of the medium, the purpose, quality and level of collaboration, and, finally, the relationship between e-assessment and teaching and learning. The results thematise how university teachers relate to technology-enabled assessment and represent incrementally expanding levels of agency within relatively recent, often hybrid assessment milieus. More importantly, the reported dimensions of variation can be utilised to inform which aspects of e-assessment warrant further attention for the improvement of formative and summative assessment design and practice.},

This paper presents the results of a survey of students, during which they expressed their opinion on the use of electronic resources in teaching. The survey showed that students are more motivated to study when they understand how their knowledge will be used in their professional activities. The survey results also showed that the objectivity of knowledge control is essential. Students are usually familiar with the criteria for assessing the performance of the task. Knowing the criteria for evaluating the task itself, understanding why it is possible to get this particular number of points for completing the task will help students to approach their studies more responsibly. We analyzed the tasks that will be offered to students in the course of learning the MAXScript language. These tasks are assessed according to factors that affect their complexity and the maximum number of points that students can receive for their correct performance. The resulting complexity value can be adjusted after analyzing the scripts written and the trainees' time. This approach to assessing tasks can be applied in the study of information technology and other disciplines.},

In this article we propose a conceptual framework for educational technology by building on Shulman's formulation of "pedagogical content knowledge" and extend it to the phenomenon of teachers integrating technology into their pedagogy. This framework is the result of 5 years of work on a program of research focused on teacher professional development and faculty development in higher education. It attempts to capture some of the essential qualities of teacher knowledge required for technology integration in teaching, while addressing the complex, multifaceted, and situated nature of this knowledge. We argue, briefly, that thoughtful pedagogical uses of technology require the development of a complex, situated form of knowledge that we call Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK). In doing so, we posit the complex roles of, and interplay among, three main components of learning environments: content, pedagogy, and technology. We argue that this model has much to offer to discussions of technology integration at multiple levels: theoretical, pedagogical, and methodological. In this article, we describe the theory behind our framework, provide examples of our teaching approach based upon the framework, and illustrate the methodological contributions that have resulted from this work.},

Analyses of activity in this perspective focus on processes of interaction of individuals with other people and with physical and technological systems'' (Greeno, Collins, and Resnick 1997). Accordingly, ``a situated view of assessment emphasizes questions about the quality of student participation in activities of inquiry and sense making, and considers assessment practices as integral components of the general systems of activity in which they occur'' (p. 37). Research on school learning from the SC perspective ``incorporates explanatory concepts that have proved useful in fields such as ethnography and sociocultural psychology to study collaborative work, {\dots}mutual understanding in conversation, and other characteristics of interaction that are relevant to the functional success of the participants' activities'' (p. 7). In such analyses, attention focuses on patterns of interactions that occur in detailed and particular situations, yields ``thick'' descriptions of the activities, and often produces voluminous data. Studies at this level of detail are essential for understanding the conditions and interactions through which students learn; that is, ``opportunities to learn'' that particular circumstances afford particular students in light of their particular personal and educational histories of experience.Yet no practical assessment at the level of the classroom, let alone a school or a program, can demand scores of hours of video per student, all analyzed by a team of graduate students, each producing a multipage ideographic report.},

Some connections depend on theories and experience concerning the targeted knowledge in the domain, how it is acquired, and the circumstances under which people bring their knowledge to bear. Other connections may depend on statistical models and probability-based reasoning. Still others concern the elements and processes involved in test construction, administration, scoring, and reporting. This paper describes a framework for assessment that makes explicit the interrelationships among substantive arguments, assessment designs, and operational processes. The work was motivated by the need to develop assessments that incorporate purposes, technologies, and psychological perspectives that are not well served by familiar forms of assessments.

  abstract = {Increasingly, student assessments of courses are being conducted online as opposed to administered in class. A growing body of research compares response rates and course ratings of courses evaluated online versus on paper. The present study extends this research by comparing student course assessments before and after the University of South Florida made online evaluations mandatory for all courses. This change only directly affected courses taught on-campus, as online courses were already being assessed online. However, we examine the effect of this change on courses taught on-campus and online, because we expect this change in policy to have differential effects. We hypothesise that by making online assessments mandatory for all courses, online assessments went from a novel method of evaluation to the norm; and, therefore, increased response rates for online courses, but had the opposite effect for on-campus courses. We find mixed support for our hypothesis. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Many universities use student evaluations of teachers (SETs) as part of consideration for tenure, compensation, and other employment decisions. However, in doing so, they may be engaging in discriminatory practices against female academics. This study further explores the relationship between gender and SETs described by MacNell, Driscoll, and Hunt (2015) by using both content analysis in student-evaluation comments and quantitative analysis of students' ordinal scoring of their instructors. The authors show that the language students use in evaluations regarding male professors is significantly different than language used in evaluating female professors. They also show that a male instructor administering an identical online course as a female instructor receives higher ordinal scores in teaching evaluations, even when questions are not instructor-specific. Findings suggest that the relationship between gender and teaching evaluations may indicate that the use of evaluations in employment decisions is discriminatory against women.}

This paper reports on a study which aimed to investigate the views of dietetics students on the usefulness of PebblePad as a learning platform and ePortfolio tool for evidencing graduate competency and enhancing employability. This research was conducted within a multi-component design-based research framework. PebblePad was introduced to the Griffith University Bachelor of Nutrition and Dietetics fouryear degree in 2016 as part of the eDGE project (ePortfolios for Dietetics Graduate Employability). Students enrolled in 1st and 3rd year courses utilising PebblePad in 2016 and 2017 were invited to complete an online survey at the conclusion of each course. Surveys were completed by 116 students (2016 n=50; 2017 n=66). Students perceived that PebblePad could impact on their employability through demonstrating their learning as well as assisting their understanding and competency development as a professional. This was more evident in 3rd year students than 1st year. The aspects of PebblePad perceived as most beneficial for employability were the ability to: 1) collate experiences and assessment; 2) evidence dietetics competencies via `tagging'; and 3) facilitate reflection. The least beneficial aspects were: 1) usability and navigation of PebblePad; 2) lack of clarity around using PebblePad to evidence employability; and 3) belief that required reflections were excessive. ePortfolios and learning platforms such as PebblePad are perceived by students to be useful for evidencing employability. Potential improvements in assessment design could further enhance their use.},

Within the context of a graduate-level course in instructional design (a core course in the Masters of Distance Education program at Athabasca University), students participated in asynchronous online discussion groups as an integral part of their course activities. Upon completion of the course, a questionnaire based on Rovai's (2002) Classroom Cohesion Scale (CSS) was administered to examine the relationship between community cohesion and students' perception of their CMC participation as well as other selected variables. The CSS was comprised of two subscales: the Connectedness subscale and the Learning Community subscale. Results revealed a significant positive correlation between community cohesion and passive CMC involvement (i.e., reading postings), but not with more active CMC involvement (e.g., making postings, replying to others' postings). Significant positive correlations were also found between course satisfaction and community cohesion (both the Learning Community and Connectedness subscales) and between program satisfaction and community cohesion (only the Connectedness subscale).

In addition, a focus group of six teaching staff was interviewed to triangulate the data and to get in-depth information on how they set the assessment pieces. The data obtained from the assessment pieces were analysed qualitatively to determine the nature and the level of questions used. The data from the interview held with the teaching staff were also analysed qualitatively to determine what informed the way they set questions. The results from the study showed that the students were mainly tested for knowledge application; and many of the questions were from the low-level category as per Bloom's Taxonomy (1956) revised for the 21st Century Learners (The University of Utah's Centre for Teaching and Learning Excellence, 2001). The results also showed that lecturers did not take into account the level at which the students were studying. University students should be required to analyse, synthesise and evaluate information before them in order to demonstrate deeper understanding. It is recommended that lecturers should apply Bloom's Taxonomy when setting assessment tasks, taking into consideration the level at which the students were studying. It is hoped that the results from the study will sensitise the teaching staff at this university and other tertiary institutions on the importance of applying Bloom's Taxonomy when assessing their students.},

  abstract = {Hybrid systems combining artificial and human intelligence hold great promise for training human skills. In this paper, I position the concept of Hybrid Human-AI Regulation and illustrate this with an example of a first prototype of a Hybrid Human-AI Regulation (HHAIR) system. HHAIR supports self-regulated learning (SRL) in the context of adaptive learning technologies (ALTs) with the aim to develop learners' self-regulated learning skills. This prototype targets young learners (10--14 years) for whom SRL skills are critical in today's society. Many of these learners use ALTs to learn mathematics and languages every day in school. ALTs optimize learning based on learners' performance data, but even the most sophisticated ALTs fail to support SRL. In fact, most ALTs take over (offload) regulation from learners. In contrast, HHAIR positions hybrid regulation as a collaborative task of the learner and the AI which is gradually transferred from AI-regulation to self-regulation. Learners will increasingly regulate their own learning progressing through different degrees of hybrid regulation. In this way HHAIR supports optimized learning and the transfer and development of SRL skills for lifelong learning (future learning). The HHAIR concept is novel in proposing a hybrid intelligence approach training human SRL skills with AI. This paper outlines theoretical foundations from SRL theory, hybrid intelligence and learning analytics. A first prototype in the context of ALTs for young learners is described as an example of hybrid human-AI regulation and future advancement is discussed. In this way, foundational theoretical, empirical, and design work are combined in articulating the concept of Hybrid Human-AI Regulation which features forward adaptive support for SRL and transfer of control between human and AI over regulation.},

The study has followed the methodology set out in the PRISMA statement, and includes 13 studies selected from a total of 51. The results indicate that faculty and students have faced numerous challenges in moving to virtual environments; on the faculty side the lack of training in online assessment techniques is the main problem, on the students' side there is dishonesty and misconduct.

  abstract = {Self-directed learning is generally considered a key competence in higher education. To enable self-directed learning, assessment practices increasingly embrace assessment for learning rather than the assessment of learning, shifting the focus from grades and scores to provision of rich, narrative, and personalized feedback. Students are expected to collect, interpret, and give meaning to this feedback, in order to self-assess their progress and to formulate new, appropriate learning goals and strategies. However, interpretation of aggregated, longitudinal narrative feedback has been proven to be very challenging, cognitively demanding, and time consuming. In this article, we, therefore, explored the applicability of existing, proven text mining techniques to support feedback interpretation. More specifically, we investigated whether it is possible to automatically generate meaningful information about prevailing topics and the emotional load of feedback provided in medical students' competence-based portfolios (N = 1500), taking into account the competence framework and the students' various performance levels. Our findings indicate that the text-mining techniques topic modeling and sentiment analysis make it feasible to automatically unveil the two principal aspects of narrative feedback, namely the most relevant topics in the feedback and their sentiment. This article, therefore, takes a valuable first step toward the automatic, online support of students, who are tasked with meaningful interpretation of complex narrative data in their portfolio as they develop into self-directed life-long learners.},

The assessment policies of 10 Australian universities that teach the OUA tertiary programmes were then reviewed to evaluate the extent to which employment-related circumstances were considered to be grounds for granting concessions and extensions. Half of these institutions' policies did not mention employment as an extenuating circumstance, others made only passing reference, and one specifically stated that work was not a valid reason for an assignment extension. In this regard, online students may not be receiving the flexible and accessible learning that online education is purported to provide. This situation highlights a broader issue, in that many online educators are using policies and protocols that are designed for traditional on-campus students without adequate adaptation for the online learner. Considerable scope therefore exists for improving online learner satisfaction and retention by more effectively accommodating online student characteristics and needs.},

  abstract = {While there has been a lot of debate over the impact of online and remote learning on mental health and well-being, there has been no systematic syntheses or reviews of the research on this particular issue. In this paper, we review the research on the relationship between mental health/well-being and online or remote learning. Our review shows that little scholarship existed prior to 2020 with most studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. We report four findings: (1) pandemic effects are not well-controlled in most studies; (2) studies present a very mixed picture, with variability around how mental health and well-being are measured and how/whether any causal inferences are made in relation to online and remote learning, (3) there are some indications that certain populations of students may struggle more in an online context, and (4) research that does not assume a direct relationship between mental health and online provides the best insight into both confounding factors and possible strategies to address mental health concerns. Our review shows that 75.5\% of published research on this topic either commits the correlation does not equal causation error or asserts a causal relationship even when it fails to establish correlations. Based on this study, we suggest that researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and administrators exercise extreme caution around making generalizable assertions with respect to the impacts of online/remote learning and mental health. We encourage further research to better understand effects on specific learner sub-populations and on course---and institution---level strategies to support mental health.},

  abstract = {Synchronous online teaching through video-conferencing software (VCS) has become a common mode of instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic. This mode brings unique challenges for teachers that require specific professional digital competences. One such challenge is conducting formative assessment. Through the use of in-depth interviews with nine Hong Kong university teachers who had taught synchronously online for one semester, this exploratory study explored the challenges of conducting formative assessment during synchronous online lessons and the strategies teachers deploy to conduct formative assessment. The findings indicate that the key difficulties include gathering information on students' needs, checking students' understanding, giving individual feedback, and building relationships with students. To address these challenges, the teachers suggested four pedagogical strategies: (1) Combine synchronous with asynchronous approaches; (2) Utilise breakout rooms; (3) Utilise poll functions of the VCS and combine it with other online platforms; and (4) Provide time before or after lessons for informal conversations. The findings suggest that teachers need to develop specific pedagogical strategies to conduct formative assessment. This provides an initial conceptualisation of one important dimension of Professional Digital Competence, teaching using digital technologies, and one aspect of that dimension, how teachers use digital tools and strategies to conduct formative assessment.},

However, the development of online written exams has been the most difficult challenge due to the commitment to ensure that the quality objectives of student assessment are reliably met. This work analyses the evolution, and the relationship of grades in written exams to determine the characteristics of a suitable and reliable remote exam. The data used were collected from the subject of Decision Methods for management science. Additionally, a global effect of the pandemic on the students performance was analyzed. For this purpose, Bayesian machine learning methods of classification were employed. Empirical results show that a proper design of the online exam should combine the following elements: adjusted time, conceptual questions, total randomization, biometric monitoring systems and additional control elements. The results also indicate that, in general, there has not been a negative global effect on student performance, concluding that the most important variable for determining the final exam grade is the type of question.},

This study examines how a school of pharmacy creatively approached the challenge of online assessment while maintaining the standards necessary to prepare practice-ready student pharmacists. To conduct traditional exams, instructors deployed two different types of methods using testing software: a video conferencing technology approach which mimicked pre-pandemic, on-campus proctored exams; or open-book, internet access-enabled exams that ensured academic integrity and rigor through various testing strategies. To assess students' clinical skills, faculty used a combination of techniques such as physical examinations, patient interviews, and patient presentations. To understand the student experience with these assessments, students were surveyed using a 12-item questionnaire. Overall, online video proctoring maintained consistency in exam structure and administration, but required extensive instruction for both students and proctors. Students preferred unproctored, open-book, internet access-enabled, standard time exams versus proctored, closed-book, internet-access disabled, extended time exams. Changes to testing procedures, whether with proctored or unproctored methods, appeared to increase student stress.},

Intercultural understanding is now a recognised core learning outcome in a large majority of Canadian public universities; however, supporting design methodology is underdeveloped, especially in online contexts. Our search for valid intercultural learning design criteria began with two questions: What is the research evidence for learning design practices that support intercultural learning? In what ways do current course design rubrics address intercultural learning? For answers, first we explored recent literature reviews, articles, books, professional discourse on cultural aspects of learning, and the related internationalisation and Indigenous literatures on formal learning. Next, we examined three course design rubrics commonly used in Canada to identify practice supports and gaps in relation to the literature. Various research-indicated supports are present in these rubrics; however, major gaps include critical and holistic pedagogies, explicit intercultural learning outcomes, and intentional diversity group work. The proposed guidelines synthesise key research-indicated supports for intercultural learning and show how they can be integrated in core online course design components. The guidelines present a base for online design methodology to support intercultural learning and enable formative evaluation of pedagogy, learning activity and assessment applications.},

  abstract = {This review will aim to establish if there is strong evidence to suggest a student preference for delivery format within information literacy teaching. This research supports and builds on research previously undertaken by Cardiff University (Weightman et al., 2017). Weightman et al (2017) addressed the effect of face-to-face or online learning specifically on learning outcomes. This review specifically focuses on the effects of these methods, and blended formats, on student preference. This research informs teaching practice specifically within Cardiff University's library service but also teaching practice generally. A comprehensive systematic literature search was undertaken in four databases: Library, Information Science and Technology Abstracts (LISTA), British Education Index, ERIC and Scopus. Seven new papers were identified to update the previous discussions on student preference of information literacy teaching format (Weightman et al., 2017). Critical appraisal was undertaken of these newly identified papers. Weightman et al.'s (2017) systematic review suggested that there was no student preference in relation to delivery format. Of the seven new papers identified in this review, two (DaCosta, 2007; Gorman \& Staley, 2018) show a slight preference for format; one for online and one for face-to-face although there are limitations to the studies. Of the five remaining studies (Craig \& Friehs, 2013; Kelly, 2017; Lag, 2016; Lapidus et al., 2012; Matlin \& Lantzy, 2017) all showed a comparable experience between formats, although limitations of these studies are also acknowledged. The update search and appraisal of the literature concurs with previous conclusions (Weightman et al., 2017) that experiences are comparable and student preference is generally neutral in relation to delivery format. Student learning outcomes and student preference are comparable regardless of format (Weightman et al., 2017).},

However, little research has investigated the influence of the technical processes of an evaluation system. In this article, we present a case study of the effects of changing the technical system for administering student evaluations at one New Zealand university. We develop a socio-technical model of the institutional evaluation system, and use this model to examine whether introducing an online system for ordering student feedback questionnaires and reducing processing time influenced academic staff engagement with evaluation. Survey responses, interview comments and data about ordering trends suggest the change did increase staff engagement by: (1) improving staff perceptions of evaluation and (2) increasing engaged behaviour, such as voluntarily ordering more evaluations. The outcomes of this study imply that the `practical implementation' of an evaluation system is an important factor in influencing engagement with evaluation. We conclude that we can increase teacher engagement with evaluation simply by improving the `practical implementation' of the evaluation system.

(b) What is construct validity, and how does it provide the basis for a unitary concept of validity?

In chapter 11, Moss, Girard, and Greeno further develop the implications of these perspectives for assessment that crosses the boundaries -- from the classroom to the school and from the school to the district, external organization, or beyond -- to serve purposes of professional learning, evaluation, and accountability.Perhaps the central message of the previous chapters on sociocultural and situative (SC/S) perspectives is that if we want to foster learning and opportunity to learn (OTL), we need to understand the dynamic ``relationship between learners and their learning environment'' (Gee, this volume, chapter 4). This includes the relationship between learners and the physical and conceptual tools in their environment; it also includes the relationship between learners and the other people in their environment. In fact, from an SC/S perspective, learning is routinely conceptualized in terms of changes in these relationships. Learners participate more proficiently in the community's activities, disciplinary concepts take on new meanings as they are put to work in solving problems, and so on. Even if one views learning as change in mental representations, the mental representation can only be acquired and demonstrated through interactions between learners and the tools and/or other people in their environment. There is no unmediated access to learning (Gee, this volume, chapter 4).},

  abstract = {This chapter takes up issues of opportunity to learn (OTL) and assessment at the level of schools, considered as organizations. An effort directed toward improving OTL for students in a school is an effort to bring about learning by the organization that is that school. The question we address is part of the general question of OTL for an organization: What kinds of resources, programs, and commitments may be needed or helpful in an effort to improve the learning effectiveness of a school? In keeping with the focus of this volume, we concentrate on issues of obtaining and using information to evaluate and support an organization's progress in changing its practices and achieving stronger OTL.In Chapter 9, Moss focuses on the practice of assessment, broadly conceived, within a single (classroom) activity system. Here, we enlarge that focus. Assessments and evaluations used to inform changes in practice across a school are practices that cross the boundaries of activity systems to support professional learning, decision making, and accountability. Here, we consider aspects of such practices, especially ways in which teachers and other participants are positioned in the processes.We begin with the premise that assessment is (or should be) at least, in part, about professionals learning to support students' learning and, in turn, to support one another's learning. Another way of saying this is that it should be about OTL for the professionals in the educational system as well as for students.},

Teachers faced many challenges when assessing students online; they were afraid that they produced inefficient or fake results. This study aims to understand the factors that affect the efficiency of e-assessment from the teachers' perspective. Many factors affect the e-exam efficiency, such as university readiness, educator readiness, plagiarism, cheating, type of assessment, and technical issues. Two hundred sixty-eight teachers were invited to fill in the questionnaire. This study concludes that university readiness, educator readiness, and type of assessment have a positive significant impact on e-exam efficiency, while plagiarism, cheating, and technical issues negatively affect e-exam efficiency Implications for practice are discussed.},

To contribute evidence-based recommendations for upholding academic integrity, we conducted a rapid scoping review focusing on what is known about academic integrity and AI in higher education before the emergence of ChatGPT. We followed the Updated Reviewer Manual for Scoping Reviews from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews Meta-Analysis for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) reporting standards. Five databases were searched, and the eligibility criteria included higher education stakeholders of any age and gender engaged with AI in the context of academic integrity from 2007 through November 2022 and available in English. The search retrieved 2,223 records, of which 14 publications with mixed methods, qualitative, quantitative, randomized controlled trials, and text and opinion studies met the inclusion criteria. The results showed bounded and unbounded ethical implications of AI. Perspectives included: AI for cheating; AI as legitimate support; an equity, diversity, and inclusion lens into AI; and emerging recommendations to tackle AI implications in higher education. The evidence from the sources provides guidance that can inform educational stakeholders in decision-making processes for AI integration, in the analysis of misconduct cases involving AI, and in the exploration of AI as legitimate assistance. Likewise, this rapid scoping review signals possibilities for future research, which we explore in our discussion.},

As a result, educators' concerns in the higher education sector quickly emerged. Many organizations and experts have addressed these concerns through recommendations. In this conceptual paper, we draw from the Integrated Model for Academic Integrity through a Scholarship of Teaching and Learning Lens to examine and stimulate discussion from eleven documents that focus on using GenAI with integrity. We identified recommendations suitable for the individual (micro), the departmental/program (meso), the institutional (macro), and the interinstitutional/ national/ international (mega) levels concerning two core elements of the model: ``high-impact professional learning for individuals and groups'' and ``local-level leadership and microcultures.'' Suggestions around the core element ``scholarship, research and inquiry'' were lacking at the micro and meso levels; likewise, recommendations for the core element ``learning spaces, pedagogies, and technologies'' were also absent at the meso, macro, and mega levels. We acknowledge that these recommendations focus on learning, involve various stakeholders, and go beyond student conduct, which aligns with current approaches to academic integrity. However, some gaps need further exploration. We highlight the need to develop more specific and practical guidance and resources for educational stakeholders around GenAI issues related to academic integrity, explore how to better support networks and leaders in higher education in creating the conditions for ethical GenAI use, and emphasizing the need for an Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion lens on GenAI.},

With the evolving digital world, conventional methods of addressing plagiarism are gradually being dismissed in favour of new technologies. Unfortunately, there is a general misunderstanding about what such technologies do. This paper was written from a PhD study, and looks at how such misunderstandings emerge across the higher education sector of one country. Institutional policies and other documents related to plagiarism were analysed from public universities across South Africa, and this was then augmented with interviews with members of institutional plagiarism committees. The results of the study revealed that technology is a key facet in these universities' attempts to reduce the incidents of plagiarism, and that Turnitin is the most favored text-matching tool. However, the software is misunderstood to be predominantly a plagiarism detection tool for policing purposes, ignoring its educational potential for student development. The implication is that, if Turnitin is primarily used as a policing tool, students are not only denied access to nuanced pedagogical interventions that might develop their academic writing, but its misuse could also change students' behavior in undesirable ways.},

  abstract = {This thesis summarizes a series of investigations into how multimedia can be designed to promote the learning of physics. The `design experiment' methodology was adopted for the study, incorporating different methods of data collection and iterated cycles of design, evaluation, and redesign. Recently much research has been conducted on learning with multimedia, usually from a cognitive science perspective. Principles of design developed in this way have not often been tested in naturalistic settings, however. Therefore in one preliminary investigation students' perceptions of a popular science video were investigated. Opinions aligned well with most principles though areas for further research were identified. In order to understand the challenges and opportunities presented by physics teaching, a survey of all lecture courses on the topic of quantum mechanics was undertaken. The lectures were a sophisticated form of multimedia, however interactivity in all lectures was low. The learning that results from this teaching was evaluated using a questionnaire on quantum tunneling, a key quantum mechanical phenomenon. The survey revealed that students had many alternative conceptions on the topic and that these could be grouped into a small number of alternative answers. This finding is similar to many of the findings from science education over the past three decades. Using this background, two multimedia treatments were developed to teach the topic of quantum tunneling. One consisted of a lecture-style explanation with only correct information presented. The other took the form of a dialogue between a tutor and student, involving several of the common alternative conceptions. Students who saw the Dialogue performed significantly better on the post-test than those who saw viii the Exposition. In order to generalize the findings, four multimedia treatments on Newton's first and second laws were created and evaluated in a similar way. A refutationary treatment, in which alternative conceptions were stated and refuted by a single speaker, and an Extended Exposition treatment were evaluated in addition to the Dialogue and Exposition. The Dialogue and Refutation outperformed the two expository treatments, confirming the benefits of including alternative conceptions. In a third iteration of the design experiment, four Newtonian mechanics treatments were evaluated with a new cohort of students. The Extended Exposition was replaced by aWorked Examples treatment in which important details were repeated to solve numerical problems. Cognitive load was directly measured in this experiment. Results showed that treatments containing alternative conceptions involved higher cognitive load and resulted in higher post-test scores than the other treatments. ix},

Students were tested using questions from mechanics conceptual inventories before and after watching the multimedia treatments. Results show the Refutation and Dialogue produced the greatest learning gains, with effect sizes of 0.79 and 0.83, respectively, compared with the Exposition. Students with low prior knowledge benefited most, however high prior knowledge learners were not disadvantaged by the misconception-based approach. The findings suggest that online multimedia can be greatly improved, promoting conceptual change in students with all levels of experience, by including a discussion of misconceptions.

However there are a number who are excluded, not because of a lack of ability but simply because they have a disability or specific need which current education systems do not address. A learning system in which content, tools and interfaces can be personalised and adapted to the individual needs and preferences of a variety of learners, including those with disabilities, becomes inclusive. Assessment is an integral part of an e-learning environment and therefore it has to provide not only inclusive e-learning content but also inclusive e-assessment. The proposed research investigates an intelligent adaptable e-learning system for assessing students' level of skill, knowledge and understanding regardless of their disabilities or accessibility needs. It is based on an innovative use of world's first open source adaptable widget design and authoring toolkit (WIDGaT) as the prototyping environment.

  abstract = {The adoption and integration of ePortfolios into third level teaching and learning provide many benefits as well as challenges. In this article, we capture the perspectives of nine academics from across seven departments within a small Higher Education Institute (HEI) who integrated ePortfolios into their teaching. Through a series of semi-structured interviews, we gained insight into the experiences of academics as they implemented various ePortfolio technologies. What is particularly notable about these participants is that the use of ePortfolios had occurred in an organic manner, often with little or no "official" support. Although, many of these organic initiatives may herald an initial flurry of positive feedback coupled with enthusiasm; the study indicates that without adequate management and support of the planning and implementation of ePortfolios there can be negative outcomes. The major conclusion drawn is that without a comprehensive and appropriate policy framework the implementation of ePortfolios is likely to run into a series of challenges. These are: fear and resistance to ePortfolios; challenges faced by students using ePortfolios; and difficulties with the integration of the technology into teaching \& learning strategies.},

There are many areas need the revolutionary changes and it has become obvious, one among is educational sector. In India, educational institutes/universities remain closed since the mid of March-2020, because of the fast spread of COVID-19. Emergency lockdown has a preventive measure upended the life of students, parents and teachers. To combat this inevitable crisis educational sectors started conducting the online classes. The sudden changeover in teaching/learning method has raised new challenges and opportunities. In this study, a survey based-investigation has been carried out to analyse the efficacy of online teaching and learning method compared to traditional teaching method. A questionnaire-based survey is prepared to collect the data from different degree students, faculties and parents with general publics. A total of 874 responses gathered from people of different background participated in the survey. The analysis of collected responses confirm that the traditional chalk and talk methodology is often better than online sessions. Results and analysis indicated that lack of facilities, infrastructure, technical tools and the internet access are the major drawback for conducting online sessions. The suggestions and recommendations are provided to improve the current online teaching methods to outreach many students and improve quality teaching/learning experience. The precautions to be taken by the universities to avoid rapid spread of COVID-19 cases are high lightened, if colleges/universities opens before vaccination.},

FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE W ORKING WITH DATA COLLECTED through a team effort or in multiple sites can be both challenging and rewarding. The sheer size and complexity of the data set sometimes makes the analy-sis daunting, cbut a large data set may also yield richer and more useful in-formation. In this chapter, we explore strategies for combining qualitative and quantitative analysis techniques for the analysis of large, qualitative data sets. Large is a relative term, of course, and many of the techniques de-scribed here are applicable to smaller data sets as well. However, the bene-fits of the data reduction techniques we propose increase as the data sets themselves grow in size and complexity. In our selection of techniques, we have taken a broad view of large qualitative data sets, aiming to highlight trends, relationships, or associations for further analysis, without deempha-sizing the importance of the context and richness of the data themselves. This perspective also brings focus to the multiple interpretive lenses that a group of researchers brings to team-based analysis. Throughout the chapter, we use examples from some of our research to illustrate the use of the methods discussed. In doing so, we identify the strengths and weaknesses of each method and suggest ways in which an ap-propriate technique may be chosen for a given research question and its corresponding data set.},

Methods: Electronic literature search was performed using PubMed, Science Direct, Ovid, ProQuest, and Google.  Then relevant literature was retrieved and was reviewed.  Results: A number of scientific evidences were identified. In general there were two types of papers: those applied framework analysis in healthcare and social investigations, and those explained about the framework analysis processes. The five steps of framework approach constitute a hierarchical thematic framework that is used to classify and organize data according to key themes, concepts and emergent categories.  Conclusion: The framework approach has become popular, especially among novice healthcare researchers, due to flexibility, easy and clear steps.},

The Roundtable convened a virtual public workshop on fostering open science practices on November 5, 2020. The broad goal of the workshop was to identify paths to growing the nascent coalition of stakeholders committed to reenvisioning credit/reward systems (e.g., academic hiring, tenure and promotion, and grants)to fully incentivize open science practices. The workshop explored the information and resource needs of researchers, research institutions, government agencies, philanthropies, professional societies, and other stakeholders interested in further supporting and implementing open science practices.

In 2000, How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School: Expanded Edition was published and its influence has been wide and deep. The report summarized insights on the nature of learning in school-aged children; described principles for the design of effective learning environments; and provided examples of how that could be implemented in the classroom. Since then, researchers have continued to investigate the nature of learning and have generated new findings related to the neurological processes involved in learning, individual and cultural variability related to learning, and educational technologies. In addition to expanding scientific understanding of the mechanisms of learning and how the brain adapts throughout the lifespan, there have been important discoveries about influences on learning, particularly sociocultural factors and the structure of learning environments. How People Learn II: Learners, Contexts, and Cultures provides a much-needed update incorporating insights gained from this research over the past decade. The book expands on the foundation laid out in the 2000 report and takes an in-depth look at the constellation of influences that affect individual learning. How People Learn II will become an indispensable resource to understand learning throughout the lifespan for educators of students and adults.},

The relationship between their approaches and confidence in classroom assessment was also established.  Methodology: A survey method was used to study the pre-service teachers' approaches to classroom assessment. One thirty-one second-year pre-service teachers from the University of Delhi, India participated in this study. A modified instrument namely `Approaches to Classroom Assessment Inventory (ACAI)' which consists of two parts was employed Simple t-test, correlation and factor analysis methods were used to analyze the data.  Main Findings: Results showed that the pre-service teachers had a better understanding of three out of five issues which include assessment purpose, measurement theory, and confidence in monitoring the assessment. However, the study found that they have an inadequate understanding of assessment design and assessment practices. Furthermore, the correlation between their approach and their confidence was very low and non-significant. The results are discussed in the context of the assessment curriculum and its transaction at the secondary teacher education program.  Implication /Applications of this study: Understanding of what pre-service teachers think about assessment issues within the current educational context helps in preparing them as better teachers. The study may provide some evidence for policymakers and curriculum framers [developers] that the importance of practical aspects of assessment in the secondary teacher education curriculum.  Novelty/Originality of this study: No study has been done so far on the different aspects of assessment approaches and its issues at pre-service teacher's level in India.},

A system walk-through strategy was used to collect qualitative data from Edmodo platform. A descriptive analysis on the data generated from a survey monkey questionnaire was employed while content analysis was carried out for qualitative data. The findings are presented based on the research questions as follows: First, it was revealed that there were several opportunities from online assessment which included divergent thinking, self-reflection and immediate feedback among students. However, the study revealed several inhibitive factors towards online assessment such as unreliable internet accessibility, lack of technological devices and negative attitudes among students. The study established that in order to have effective online formative assessment, the capacity building to both instructors and students is inevitable. Furthermore, the study calls for the need to harmonize the curriculum by capitalizing on the integration of online formative assessment to support blended learning among digital native students at all levels of education.},

  abstract = {Teaching Analytics (TA) is a new theoretical approach, which combines teaching expertise, visual analytics and design-based research to support teacher's diagnostic pedagogical ability to use data and evidence to improve the quality of teaching. TA is now gaining prominence because it offers enormous opportunities to the teachers. It also identifies optimal ways in which teaching performance can be enhanced. Further, TA provides a platform for teachers to use data to reflect on teaching outcome. The outcome of TA can be used to engage teachers in a meaningful dialogue to improve the quality of teaching. Arguably, teachers need to develop their teacher data literacy and data inquiry skills to learn about teaching challenges. These skills are dependent on understanding the connection between TA, LA and Learning Design (LD). Additionally, they need to understand how choices in particular pedagogues and the LD can enhance their teaching experience. In other words, teachers need to equip themselves with the knowledge necessary to understand the complexity of teaching and the learning environment. Providing teachers access to analytics associated with their teaching practice and learning outcome can improve the quality of teaching practice. This research aims to explore current TA related discussions in the literature, to provide a generic conception of the meaning and value of TA. The review was intended to inform the establishment of a framework describing the various aspects of TA and to develop a model that can enable us to gain more insights into how TA can help teachers improve teaching practices and learning outcome. The Tripartite model was adopted to carry out a comprehensive, systematic and critical analysis of the literature of TA. To understand the current state-of-the-art relating to TA, and the implications to the future, we reviewed published articles from the year 2012 to 2019. The results of this review have led to the development of a conceptual framework for TA and established the boundaries between TA and LA. From the analysis the literature, we proposed a Teaching Outcome Model (TOM) as a theoretical lens to guide teachers and researchers to engage with data relating to teaching activities, to improve the quality of teaching.},

  abstract = {Assessment and grading in higher education have traditionally focused on ``A'' through ``F'', or point-based alpha-numeric letter grades and subjective, independent grading systems. Despite the ubiquity of this system, there are no universal guidelines on how to assess student learning on that scale. What can be problematic about ``the way things have always been'' is that students are frequently de-humanized; higher education faculty often focus on compliance and authoritarian teaching rather than engaging in the learning process alongside the students. In contrast, some faculty members have explored non-traditional assessment practices in their coursework to enhance the learning process and improve individualized student support. This article offers strategies for implementing non-traditional assessments, specifically mediated office hours, mastery learning, and ungrading strategies are addressed.},

Our findings uncovered several underlying factors that influenced how instructors designed their modules and highlighted some discrepancies between instructors' pedagogical beliefs and their actual LD as captured by the Open University Learning Design Initiative (OULDI). This study showcases the potential of combining LA with qualitative insights for a better understanding of the complex design process in online distance higher education.},

To collect the data, a project-based assessment design was applied for 124 English major students at B University in the 9 weeks ICC course. This project was implemented from the beginning of the course, and at the end of the course, learners' products were performed with specific activities regarding culture knowledge competition, online cultural community activities, talent performance, situational judgment ability, and eloquence skills. In addition, a set of questionnaires were delivered to the participants, plus the interviews with 36 teachers who have taught culture-related subjects from the universities in Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia. The findings revealed that although there were certain challenges, using project-based assessment in teaching culture had satisfactory effects on students' intercultural competence, problem- solving skills, critical thinking, and learning motivation.},

The paper thus contributes to recent debates about sustainable assessment and how to change assessment to better support students for lifelong learning in different countries. The findings suggest that although more elements were found at Midlands University than Nam Du University, assessment in both cases was an imperfect realisation of this framework. Nonetheless, the paper argues that the framework can offer guidance for changes to align assessment practices with lifelong learning, but to do this it should be adapted to the education context and also expanded to include explicit social commitments to others for expansive lifelong learning.},

Various studies performed over the last 30 or so years since Mezirow's theory was first proposed have confirmed its presence and importance in higher education. However, the question remains as to whether transformative learning takes place in vocational distance and online education--particularly if it's not explicitly promoted. This paper investigates the extent of transformative learning taking place in adult learners studying at a distance, online. Drawing on King's Learning Activities Survey (LAS), Open Polytechnic students (n=499) across seven qualifications (six discipline areas) responded to a survey asking about their experience of perspective transformation. The instrument also sought insight as to how vocational providers of vocational online and distance education might promote transformative learning outcomes in learners. Survey results show evidence of perspective transformation in students to varying degrees that are mainly determined by the qualification being studied. The results also reveal which instructional design approaches and teaching activities might contribute to transformation.},

Tutors most valued the ability to monitor students' progress and provide rapid feedback on work. Some also valued the ease of the marking process and the positive impact on tutorials. However, portfolio organisation adversely impacted on the marking process for some, while others struggled with the effect of the online approach on face-to-face meetings, highlighting the need for further guidance on tutorial management. Quantitative analysis of student grades tentatively indicates higher attainment levels for online portfolios compared with printed equivalents. The findings suggest that online portfolios, combined with progress monitoring, peer learning, feedback practice, and intrinsic motivation, can promote student engagement.},

Citation indices help measure the interconnections between scientific papers but fall short because they fail to communicate contextual information about a citation. The use of citations in research evaluation without consideration of context can be problematic because a citation that presents contrasting evidence to a paper is treated the same as a citation that presents supporting evidence. To solve this problem, we have used machine learning, traditional document ingestion methods, and a network of researchers to develop a ``smart citation index'' called scite, which categorizes citations based on context. Scite shows how a citation was used by displaying the surrounding textual context from the citing paper and a classification from our deep learning model that indicates whether the statement provides supporting or contrasting evidence for a referenced work, or simply mentions it. Scite has been developed by analyzing over 25 million full-text scientific articles and currently has a database of more than 880 million classified citation statements. Here we describe how scite works and how it can be used to further research and research evaluation.},

Specifically, we discuss two common characteristics of principled assessment design approaches and propose three criteria for evaluating theories of learning and cognition. We then demonstrate the use of these criteria using a learning progression on geometric measurement of area. Finally, we summarize the implications of these decisions for constructing an argument for the validity of assessment results interpretation and use and suggest future directions for principled assessment design.},

In initial teacher education, a call has been made to better prepare pre-service teachers for this complex task. Advances in technology allow this training to be done through authentic learning environments, such as video-based simulations. To understand the learning process in such simulations, it is necessary to determine how cognitive and motivational learner characteristics influence situative learning experiences, such as the perception of authenticity, cognitive load, and situational motivation, during the simulation and how they affect aspects of performance. In the present study, N = 150 pre-service teachers from German universities voluntarily participated in a validated online video-based simulation targeting on-the-fly student assessments. We identified three profiles of learner characteristics: one with above average knowledge, one with above average motivational-affective traits, and one with below average knowledge and motivational-affective traits. These profiles do not differ in the perception of the authenticity of the simulation. Furthermore, the results indicate that the profiled learners navigate differently through the simulation. The knowledgeable learners tended to outperform learners of the other two profiles by using more learning time for the assessment process, also resulting in higher judgment accuracy. The study highlights how learner characteristics and processes interact, which helps to better understand individual learning processes in simulations. Thus, the findings may be used as a basis for future simulation research with a focus on adaptive and individual support.},

Critiques of remote proctoring abound, and there are a variety of perspectives particularly in relation to the advantages and disadvantages of this type of assessment, and opportunities for cheating. However, these perspectives are largely based on rhetoric with limited empirical data to support or refute the value of remote proctoring. This study used mixedmethods to investigate the experiences, and perceptions of cheating in open-book online proctored exams. An online questionnaire and interviews were conducted with students and academics. Data analysis revealed that the experience of online proctored exams was generally positive although there were mixed preferences for online versus on-campus exams. A variety of advantages and disadvantages of online proctored exams were also identified. Whilst both students and academics reported that they believed students would cheat, actual instances of cheating (as reported by students or academics) were minimal. This may have been because of the use of open-book exams. Based on these findings we comment on the reality versus the rhetoric relating to online proctored exams and suggest a range of ways forward for universities.},

It also explores how technology might support formative assessment practices in the current higher education context, where modularisation, larger student numbers and lower staff-student ratios have all reduced opportunities for formative support. A framework is proposed for the design of large-cohort first-year courses based on two recent literature reviews. This provides a lens through which to analyse two first-year courses (Psychology and French) that were redesigned with funding from the Re-engineering Assessment Practices (REAP) project. Evaluations show that both course redesigns resulted in high levels of student satisfaction, in performance improvements in final exams when compared with previous years and in workload efficiency gains brought about by the application of technology. Ways of improving on these designs based on the proposed framework are discussed.},

A digital explanation is a multimodal artefact created by students to explain science to a specified audience, which is an alternate form of assessment that has potential to develop and assess these other important forms of knowledge and skills. This research draws from perspectives in multimodality, educational semiotics and science education to gain a better understanding of digital explanation as a form of assessment in university science. Data sources include digital artefacts (n = 42), task descriptions and rubrics and pre-/post-interviews (n = 21) with students who created them as a task in a university science subject. Analysis involved identifying the range of media resources used across the data set, seeking patterns in how multiple resources were used and exploring students' perspectives on the task, including their design decisions. A more detailed look at artefacts from three different science learning contexts illustrates that students base their design decisions on the content knowledge being represented, their technical capabilities to generate them and how to engage the audience. Students enjoy this form of assessment and feel that the tasks allowed them to demonstrate different sorts of capabilities than are normally assessed in their subjects. Recommendations for instructors provide guidance for considering this sort of task in tertiary science contexts.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The construction of dynamic multimedia products requires the selection and integration of a range of semiotic resources. As an assessment task for preservice teachers, this construction process is complex but has significant potential for learning. To investigate how weaving together multiple representations in such tasks enables learners to develop conceptual understanding, the paper presents an indicative case study of a 2nd-year preservice primary (K-6) teacher who created a digital explanation on the topic of `transparency' for stage 3 children (ages 11--12). We focus on data gathered during the 3-h construction process including artefacts such as images, online searches, websites accessed and paper records used for planning; the digital explanation as product; audio and video capture of the construction process and pre- and post-construction interviews. Using multimodal analysis, we examine these data to understand how meanings are negotiated as the maker moves iteratively among multiple representations and through semiotic choices within these representations to explain the science concept. The analyses illustrate the complexity of the construction process while providing insight into the creator's decision-making and to her developing semiotic and conceptual understandings. These findings allow us to build on the concept of cumulative semiotic progression (Hoban \& Nielsen,               Research in Science Education               , 35, 1101-1119, 2013) by explicating the role of iterative reasoning in the production of pedagogic multimedia.},

However, previous frameworks for authentic assessment appear not to explicitly address how authenticity intersects with a broader digital world. This critical scoping review describes how the digital has been designed into authentic assessment in the higher education literature. Our findings imply that the digital was most often used to enhance assessment design and to develop students' digital skills. Other purposes for designing the digital into assessment were less present. Only eight studies situated the students within the wider context of digital societies, and none of the studies addressed students' critical digital literacies. Thus, while there are pockets of good practice found within the literature, the vast majority of the studies employed the digital as an instrumental tool for garnering efficiencies. We suggest that in order to fit its purpose of preparing students for the digital world, the digital needs to be designed into authentic assessment in meaningful ways.},

  abstract = {Universal Design has been promoted to address the diversity of learners in higher education. However, rarely have Universal Design implementations been evaluated by listening to the voices of disabled students. For this study, we investigated the perceptions of three disabled students who took part in an undergraduate mathematics course designed with the principles of Universal Design for Learning and Assessment. The study consists of two parts. First, we observed the experiences students had in relation to the accessibility of the course design. The second part consisted of a further analysis of the students identifying processes to understand how they talked about their learning disabilities during the course. Our results highlight many opportunities and challenges that the course offered to the students, whilst also raising concerns about how the students excluded themselves from their student cohort in their identifying narratives. Based on our results, we argue that Universal Design should be returned to its roots by connecting it with the social model of disability. We call for future research to learn from our mistakes and consider the identifying processes of the students while designing, and hopefully co-designing, inclusive learning environments in mathematics.},

Are students' perceived needs to learn more and their level of interest in becoming information literate related to their pursuit of information literacy (IL) skill development? First-year undergraduates, master's, and PhD students ( N\,=\,760) took an objective IL test and estimated their scores both before and after the test. IL ability, as well as students' estimation of their IL ability, increased with higher education experience and IL test experience, though also varied notably within groups. Low-performers tended to overestimate their abilities, while high-performers tended to underestimate them---both evidence of the Dunning-Kruger effect. Furthermore, gender comparisons revealed that men tended to estimate higher, and more accurate, scores than women. Finally, PhD students reported greater interest in becoming information literate than undergraduates. Although undergraduates felt a greater need to learn more, PhD students were more inclined to pursue IL growth. For both groups, interest in becoming information literate correlated far more with their likelihood to invest effort into developing IL competencies than their perceived need to know more. What implications might these findings have for how we conceptualize the teaching of IL?},

Challenges faced by the course team included adding flexibility to the curricula, increasing learner engagement (both with learning materials and feedback) and reducing learner isolation. As part of a coordinated enhancement effort, which included changes to curriculum design and delivery, 59 podcasts were introduced into the curriculum over a 12?month period. Qualitative and quantitative data were gathered from students and staff throughout the study. Action research ensured a regular flow of relevant evidence informing each stage of the renewal process. Evidence suggested that the students? learning experiences improved as a result of four key benefits associated with the integration of podcasting in learning design: personalisation; an additional and different format for providing clear and engaging guidance, support and feedback; increased flexibility and mobility within the curricula; and ?design once, deliver many times? with minimum adaptation.}

It is deemed in the concurrent involvement of different assessment agents (teacher, peer and self) into integrated and collaborative translation performance evaluation from two perspectives, i.e. translation product quality and process workflow, with the use of diversified methods based on different theoretical approaches. This research aims at the study of students' video screen recording contribution combined with think-aloud protocols (TAPs) to increase the assessment objectivity and reliability of the received translation product. Method: A mixed research design was developed and implemented. It involved 40 third-year university students majoring in Philology, who were asked to perform a written translation of the excerpt of English popular science article in Marketing (c. 250 words) into Ukrainian in MS Word using any reference sources at hand, video record the process of their translation and accompany it with their comments. The research was completed with the questionnaire on students' attitude to the screen recording and TAP involvement into translation task performance and assessment. Findings: The findings of this study reported on the positive impact of screen recording on the assessment accuracy, informative value of the collected data and formative effect of triangulated assessment method on students' translation competence acquisition. Implications for research and practice: The received results can serve for the optimisation of the procedures of translation task difficulty measurement and competence assessment in the translation classroom.},

Due to the current pandemic situation, higher education environments are all now forced to move away from traditional teaching and learning structures that are simply no longer adaptable to the challenges of rapidly changing educational environments. This research develops a conceptual model and employs Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) using Partial least Squares (PLS) to examine the impact of information and digital literacy on 249 Finnish university staff and students' intention to use digital technologies. The findings show the complex interrelationship between literacy skills and digital technologies among university staff and students. The results illustrate that information literacy has a direct and significant impact on intention to use; while, unlike our expectation, digital literacy does not have a direct impact on the intention to use. However, its effect is mediated through performance expectancy and effort expectancy. The authors suggest that to understand the changes that are taking place in higher education environment, more attention needs to be paid to redefining policies and strategies in order to enhance individuals' willingness to use digital technologies within higher education environments.},

While logistically, the use of digital technologies offers an obvious solution, attention must be given to these methods' pedagogical appropriateness, mainly how students engage and learn in the spaces supported by these technologies. In this context, we explored the degree to which digital technologies have contributed to teaching and learning practices over the past decade. The study employed a systematic review using a newly developed tripartite model for conducting and presenting literature review reports. The model approaches the literature review process systematically and employs three phases for the critical examination of literature: description, synthesis, and critique. The current review focused on student engagement across technologies that encompass social media, video, and collaborative learning technologies. Relevant articles were obtained from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Three core themes were identified: there was no shared understanding of what constitutes student engagement with learning technologies, there was a lack of explanation concerning the contextual variation and modalities of student engagement across the digital technologies, and self-reporting was the primary method of measuring student engagement, rendering results as perceptual rather than behavioural. We argue that using multiple datasets and different methodological approaches can provide further insights into student engagement with digital technologies. This approach to measuring engagement can substantiate findings and most likely provide additional insights into students' engagement with digital technologies.},

Negative expectations of e-assessment (i.e., workload and time overload) were dispelled while ideas about the expected benefits were realized (i.e., flexibility, mobility and comfort). Attitudes toward e-assessment remained positive despite the technical difficulties that arose during the pilot. The use of security mechanisms was perceived as beneficial and opened up new opportunities for innovative practices in e-assessment but caused some mistrust or sense of invasiveness among participants.

  abstract = {Telehealth visits have become an integral model of healthcare delivery since the COVID-19 pandemic. This rapid expansion of telehealthcare delivery has forced faculty development and trainee education in telehealth to occur simultaneously. In response, academic medical institutions have quickly implemented clinical training to teach digital health skills to providers across the medical education continuum. Yet, learners of all levels must still receive continual assessment and feedback on their skills to align with the telehealth competencies and milestones set forth by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). This paper discusses key educational needs and emerging areas for faculty development in telehealth teaching and assessment of telehealth competencies. It proposes strategies for the successful integration of the AAMC telehealth competencies and ACGME milestones into medical education, including skills in communication, data gathering, and patient safety with appropriate telehealth use. Direct observation tools in the paper offer educators novel instruments to assess telehealth competencies in medical students, residents, and peer faculty. The integration of AAMC and ACGME telehealth competencies and the new assessment tools in this paper provide a unique perspective to advance clinical practice and teaching skills in telehealthcare delivery.},

We need to a look at innovative approaches to building and sustaining a highly qualified workforce in Ontario.  One of the innovative (and cost-effective) ways to do this is through the systematic use of online learning, an area where Ontario is a recognized leader in Canada.}

  abstract = {Research on professional assessment practice in higher education does not always take account of lecturers' perceptions and experiences, or their disciplinary context. This questionnaire study was designed to explore lecturers' views about three inter-related elements of professional assessment practice: assessment design, marking and feedback. It consisted of two questionnaires: the Assessment Design Inventory (ADI), previously published, and the Assessment, Marking and Feedback Inventory (AMFI) which was newly developed for this study. The two main purposes of the research were to: i) establish the validity of these two questionnaires as research tools, ii) explore the existence of professional practice in assessment and analyse any perceived hindrances as well as possible effects of participants' subject discipline. 356 lecturers from two UK universities, with a range of teaching experience and representing soft and hard disciplines, took part. Results indicated that the ADI and the AMFI were robust instruments. Findings showed evidence of assessment professionalism, but also some areas where it was lacking, together with a perceived need for formal training. Participants recognised that there were certain hindrances in putting their pedagogical beliefs into practice. The implications of this study are discussed in terms of advancing the sector's understanding of assessment professionalism.},

In this review, we address how migrant students are affected by assessment, both summative and formative, at the classroom level, with a focus on culturally responsive assessment (CRA). Previous research has shown that CRA practices mainly occur in student-centred classrooms. Furthermore, both student and teacher beliefs about teaching and learning might negatively affect migrant students' opportunities to engage in assessment situations. Teaching and assessment practices should be negotiated and aligned with and included in classroom norms to be culturally responsive. We propose that what is generally considered a valid and reliable assessment practice might need to be adjusted to account for students' cultural ways of knowing and participating and how this is expressed and communicated within the classroom.},

While existing scholarship on platformisation and assetisation has highlighted important concerns about the distribution of power and value in contemporary higher education, much of this literature privileges a top-down focus on the edtech industry or the workings of particular platforms at the expense of lived experience. Departing from this critique, I explore what platformisation looks and feels like in the lives of students by presenting `platform maps' created and narrated by university students in Scotland. The accounts show how student agency is enabled, constrained and shaped by platformisation and how students come to depend on platforms in their everyday lives. In the process, students' lives and higher education more broadly become entangled with dynamics of platformisation in complicated and problematic ways.},

We describe our methodology for constructive alignment that begins with a close examination of the learning outcomes (LOs), considers the authentic activities that support these LOs and develops assessment tasks, which are authentic and valid. We also describe how group projects contributed to the course structure and how peer assessment was designed to provide formative feedback to the students.},

Criteria for effective, high quality feedback are discussed. An automated marking system (The Marker's Apprentice--TMA) produces instant feedback in synergy with the highlighted best practises. This paper investigates improvements in the work submitted by students after receiving this type of feedback. It draws upon surveys, as well as comparisons to previous cohorts for validating the positive impact of these techniques. It was found that the cohort (141 students) made 35\% fewer common mistakes on a subsequent exercise than the previous cohort. 100\% of students surveyed (35) claimed to have read the feedback, and 91\% agreed it clearly identified areas for improvement. 68\% agreed the feedback is useful for their learning, which is backed up by the improvements seen on the last exercise. Supported by these results, this paper concludes that following feedback best practises can have a substantial impact on learning, and that automated assessment can play a key role in providing this instant, high quality feedback. The results and similar techniques can be applied to other disciplines.},

The instruments are linked through the same dispositional themes that undergird the indicators in the CDPA and belief statements in the SAS. Internal consistency reliability coefficients were determined using Cronbach's alpha for SAS (0.81) and the CDPA (0.96). In addition, inter-rater reliability coefficient of 0.80 was determined for CDPA using Intraclass correlation (ICC) method based on one-way random model and absolute agreement. It is argued that using these instruments in tandem, SAS at program entry and CDPA as well as SAS at program exit, offers a viable solution to assessing and monitoring candidates' development and acquisition of dispositions needed for effective performance in the teaching profession.},

Transaction-level data, which records all of the steps a student uses to complete an assessment item, are preferred over traditional assessment formats that submit only the final answer, as the system can detect persistent misconceptions. In this study we collected transaction-level data from 996 students enrolled in an online introductory spreadsheet class. Each student's final answer and step-by-step attempts were coded for misconceptions or knowledge gaps regarding the use of absolute references over four assessment occasions. Overall, the level of error revealed was significantly higher in the step-by-step processes compared to the final submitted answers. Further analysis suggests that students most often have misconceptions regarding non-critical errors. Data analysis also suggests that misconceptions identified at the transaction level persist over time.},

  abstract = {Racial bias in health algorithms                            The U.S. health care system uses commercial algorithms to guide health decisions. Obermeyer               et al.               find evidence of racial bias in one widely used algorithm, such that Black patients assigned the same level of risk by the algorithm are sicker than White patients (see the Perspective by Benjamin). The authors estimated that this racial bias reduces the number of Black patients identified for extra care by more than half. Bias occurs because the algorithm uses health costs as a proxy for health needs. Less money is spent on Black patients who have the same level of need, and the algorithm thus falsely concludes that Black patients are healthier than equally sick White patients. Reformulating the algorithm so that it no longer uses costs as a proxy for needs eliminates the racial bias in predicting who needs extra care.                                         Science               , this issue p.               447               ; see also p.               421                        ,              A health algorithm that uses health costs as a proxy for health needs leads to racial bias against Black patients.           ,              Health systems rely on commercial prediction algorithms to identify and help patients with complex health needs. We show that a widely used algorithm, typical of this industry-wide approach and affecting millions of patients, exhibits significant racial bias: At a given risk score, Black patients are considerably sicker than White patients, as evidenced by signs of uncontrolled illnesses. Remedying this disparity would increase the percentage of Black patients receiving additional help from 17.7 to 46.5\%. The bias arises because the algorithm predicts health care costs rather than illness, but unequal access to care means that we spend less money caring for Black patients than for White patients. Thus, despite health care cost appearing to be an effective proxy for health by some measures of predictive accuracy, large racial biases arise. We suggest that the choice of convenient, seemingly effective proxies for ground truth can be an important source of algorithmic bias in many contexts.},

  abstract = {The construct of oral ability is multifaceted, but due to technological and practical constraints, the majority of computer-delivered speaking assessments are designed to measure only certain aspects of this ability. Most notably, interactional competence, which we define as the ability to actively structure dialogic speech in real time, is often not assessed. Innovations in technology, namely, computermediated video, make it possible for test takers in different locations to see and speak with others in real time and may make it achievable for computer-based tests to assess more aspects of oral communication, including interactional competence. This report gives the findings from a study that explored to what extent computer-mediated video, namely, Skype, could function in conjunction with a platform designed to present four innovative speaking tasks that could conceivably assess a broad construct of oral ability. The overarching goals of this project were twofold. First, we aimed to determine (a) the degree to which current computer video-mediated technology can be used effectively to deliver assessments remotely and (b) the extent to which participants felt that four specific tasks could assess speaking ability by means of this technology. The speaking tasks included giving short responses to an interlocutor's questions, summarizing a proposal, defending a position in a group discussion, and giving a prepared presentation and responding to questions from other participants. Two data collections were conducted: one with all 72 participants located in the United States and one with all 74 participants located in China. The findings provide preliminary evidence that the stability of computer video-mediated technology varies considerably, with technical disruptions being relatively few in the U.S. trial but very frequent in the China context. Moreover, the findings suggest that participants viewed the tasks as generally representing interactive speaking activities that they encounter in the oral language use domain, affording them the opportunity to demonstrate their oral abilities, and that these tasks can be effectively completed in a computer video-mediated environment when technology cooperates.},

Literature suggests that with the increase in the use of Information and Communications Technology in the delivery of learning, a number of institutions are resorting to formative assessment practices that are mediated by technology to not only provide flexible and more efficient means of assessment but also attain improved learning outcomes. This paper investigated student perceptions of the effectiveness of different types of formative assessment used in online learning environments. A 31-item questionnaire was used to gather data on student perceptions. On the level of difficulty, students generally perceived the various types of formative assessment as having no significant differences. Results further indicated that students received more prompt feedback from peer assessment and computer-marked assessment, compared to teacher-marked assessment. The findings of this study will support practitioners in eLearning to use formative assessment and feedback mechanisms more effectively to influence student engagement as well as learning outcomes.},

This editorial suggests that the post-pandemic period will be dominated by three primary groups -- The New Kids in Town, The Savvy Shifty Shifters, and the Retrenchment Innovators. Leaders in these groups will need to make major organizational decisions about their future in the online learning market. Leaders will need to lead their organizations through three main phases -- Phase 1 - emergency response; Phase 2 -- decision matrix; and 3) embedding the new organizational culture. Leadership will be crucial to navigating a highly competitive higher education landscape where more providers in online learning will create more options for students to pursue their higher education goals. Competition will be fierce and intense in higher education. Leaders will need to differentiate their organization from competitors and ensure that culture and context are considered in their vision. The game changer in this new normalcy will be visionary and transformational leadership.},

Since these skills are increasingly being recognized by employes, the chances for the Faculdade de Ciencias e Tecnologia of Universidade Nova de Lisboa s students to be successful in the job market tend to increase. However, the calendar changes resulting from this pedagogical model imposed serious management problems concerning assessment using on-paper tests, specially to courses with a high number of enrolled students (ranging from 200 to 800).Here we present a methodology that is being used since 2012 that proved to successfully overcome those difficulties. The methodology embraces the whole process of assessment using on-paper tests from its beginning (test authoring) to grades publication. The methodology implementation enabled a significant decrease of faculty s exam/test proctoring time, reduced the grading time for less than an hour, and permitted a much more efficient use of university s rooms dedicated to tests. Moreover, allowed many professors to convey many hours previously spent in related test activities to their research and teaching innovation activities.},

Among the tools available for online learning, there are Online Discussion Forums (ODF), due to their potential to promote collaborative learning. However, there is a lack in the literature about the evaluation of the forums, a gap marked by the absence of quantitative tools that make it possible to evaluate the forums from the student's perspective. In this sense, the objective of this paper was to develop and validate a Quality Perception of Online Discussion Forums (QPODF) scale. To this end, quantitative research was carried out with students of postgraduate courses "lato sensu" the online distance education. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis was used to validate the QPODF scale. The results demonstrate that the quality of the construct perceived online discussion forums has two dimensions "Forum Structure" and "Forum Mediation." The two identified factors were shown to be consistent and accurate to measure the quality of online forums. Moreover, the theoretical approach used to compose the scale is convergent with the measurement model proposed in the paper.},

To study changes in grading, we collected data in two New York high schools undergoing a year-long professional development program on rethinking grading. We not only used existing literature on grading to frame our study but also relied on institutional theory and teacher identity as frameworks. We found that productive teacher change occurred, but it was partial, tentative, contingent on school-wide support, and not without frustration on the part of teachers.},

In our study, we aimed to take advantage of student affinity to technology to drive spatial ability improvements (in the context of chemistry) by having students experience molecules in virtual space using modern viewing technologies (WBVE, AR, and VR). Students were first engaged with the technologies then were assessed to see if their ability to solve problems relating to 3D-molecular structure improved. The mean spatial ability of students improved over the course of the semester (permutation test, p {$<$} 0.05) and students using model kits scored higher than those using the technologies (t-test, p {$<$} 0.05).

This paper describes strategies used to effectively incorporate smartphones into the classroom to enhance teaching and learning. Examples of innovative teaching practices to improve student understanding and performance using a classroom response system app are provided. Ways to capitalize on the benefits and minimize distractions from smartphone use are discussed. Data from exit surveys administered to assess students' perception of mobile technology effectiveness in the classroom are also reported. Results suggest that using this technology enhances student understanding of course concepts. Using the strategies outlined in this paper, professors will gain insight into students' understanding of course materials and these insights could be used to guide current and future lesson plans.},

  abstract = {Summary Group-level educational survey assessments have traditionally not been designed for reporting on test taker's specific application of cognition because they are based on broad frameworks from which topics are sampled, rather than built from comprehensive and connected cognitive models and focused on probing aspects of those models. However, more recently assessment goals have been shifting, leading to a different view on what these assessments ought to produce, in part due to the affordances of technology that put expanding measurement and reporting goals within reach. In this chapter we describe how complex interactive tasks produce complex data streams that can be used to create rich narratives about test-takers and reflect a more differentiated understanding of the cognitive, meta-cognitive, and noncognitive factors that affect learning and performance. We argue that expanded large-scale assessment measurement and reporting goals require a significant level of cognitive and learning theory focused on tracking test-taker behaviors of interest and explaining the significance of what is tracked. We show several innovative examples from the NAEP program where important inroads have been made and discuss critical future developments in this line of work.},

  abstract = {Testing creativity in tertiary learning activities is a young field of research, and current assessment methods are difficult to apply within the diverse context of media production education, where disciplines range from journalism through to video game production. However, the concept of remix is common across this wide range of media, and offers practitioners `endless hybridizations in language, genre, content, technique and the like' (Knobel \& Lankshear, 2008, p. 22). The conceptual commonality of remix indicates that the study conclusions will have useful implications across a range of media production disciplines. This study aims to consider new methods for testing creativity in media production learning activities and to provide better assessments for learning design. This study focused upon a learner cohort of music technology students that were undertaking a work-integrated learning programme with a record label. To make the students more work-ready and inspire greater creativity, they remixed tracks recorded by professional music artists as part of a unit assessment. Subsequent self-report surveys ( N = 29) found that the process of creating a `remix' enhanced their creativity and provided suggested improvements to the design of the learning experience. Importantly, we found no relationship between the survey responses and objective assessments, indicating that the self-reported improvements in creativity were not simply a measure of how well the students performed the formally assessed tasks. Although more research is needed to establish effective measures of creativity, these findings demonstrate that self-report survey tools can be a powerful tool for measuring creativity and supporting improved iterative learning design.},

  abstract = {Many educational institutions have adopted online assessment in recent years. Previous studies on online assessment have often been tied to studies on learning management systems. As such, questions of online assessment acceptance have typically been overshadowed by a focus on the acceptance of learning management systems in general. The focus of the present research on online assessment is relatively rare. This paper describes the validation of an instrument to measure online assessment adoption by lecturers in higher education.~A total of 213~participants responded to a 20-item online questionnaire. With the data collected and the model fit, the instrument developed was able to meet the expectations to measure online assessment. The preliminary evidence of the validity of the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model, based on its reliability found in the current study, supports the use of the instrument as a technology acceptance framework for online assessment systems. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model has been found to be a reliable and robust model to study and explain technology acceptance and use across various educational contexts. In the UTAUT model, performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI) and facilitating conditions are direct determinants of user acceptance and use behaviour. Subsequent validation by Venkatesh et al. (2003) in a longitudinal study found that the UTAUT model was a competent model that explained the relationships between PE, EE, SI and user behavioural intention (BI). What this paper adds An extended UTAUT model has been proposed, with the removal of EE as many UTAUT studies have shown that its influence has not been as consistent as compared to that of the other original constructs. In its place, constructs such as usability and learnability have been added as potential influences on both BI and use behaviour. Attitude as a construct has been added, as this was first included in an earlier Technology Acceptance Model but absent in the original UTAUT model. Development of a validated instrument suitable for assessing educators' acceptance of online assessment based on the extended UTAUT model. Implications for practice and/or policy The instrument proposed in this study can be used as a tool to examine educators' perception on online assessment. The instrument can also be used as a tool to inform educational institutions the factors that influence the successful implementation of online assessment or assessment-related systems. Based on its reliability found in the current study, this study supports the use of the instrument as a technology acceptance framework for online assessment systems.},

  abstract = {You have to feel the language in your heart: what good is it for me to do something that I don't want to do? When I'm doing attendance, they'll say, 'Here' in Mi'kmaq. At first they had a hard time with it, and then finally, no one laughed and they got it. If they want to leave the room for something, they have to ask in Mi'kmaq. It has to be encouraged in the home. The residential schools beat the Mi'kmaq out of us, and it's about time that someone put it back. Schools should treat their kids right and be a happy place where they want to go. Instead, all they hear is, `Get in line!' and `Sit down!' If you are walking with your kids and they're laughing, someone says, `Oh my gosh, she can't even keep her kids in a straight line.' To me, kids talking and making noise is learning. Sometimes if I want to work individually with one person, I'll pair the other students up and ask them to try and learn together. They're learning how to help each other, and that's the Mi'kmaq way. My class isn't about, 'Sit at your seat and raise your hand if you need to answer or ask a question.' There are days when I will be strict with assignments that need to be done, but there are days when I feel like learning is best when it is informal. If they come up to the front, ask questions, and sit on a desk, it's not necessarily a sign of disrespect. They don't have to sit in a chair to learn. It's a sign of comfort; they want to be close to me. They come to me and they are not afraid to ask any question, whether it be in terms of my life history or sexuality or whatever. They know I'll be honest with them, and I'm not afraid to answer. I'll answer in a professional manner, which makes it less intimidating for them. Most of the students fight to be near the front of the room. If kids are lying on the desks with their calculators, it doesn't bother me because they are learning. If you want to be comfortable, then so be it. We're all in this together, and we're respectful. I love my kids to be learning in that kind of environment, without telling them, 'sit at your seat, raise your hand, open your book and take your hat off.' It's more time-consuming, so I don't dwell on these things. But I won't tolerate swearing. And coming to class without your books is another one I discourage. But other than that, if students want to sit at my desk to listen, then fine, sit at my desk. If you want to type your notes, then sure, you don't have to use a pen. Not too many high school classes are like that. In my class we have a homework derby. Every time they do their homework they get a ballot and it goes in the derby for prizes. We draw every Friday, and they like to win stuff, so they always want homework, and they will finish it. They'll say, `Please, Miss, what's for homework? The bell's gonna ring!' At first I gave them homework that was easy, just to get them started on getting ballots. I fund it myself, but it really helps in terms of getting the students motivated to do their homework. I'm making it fun, and they know the more times they get ballots, the more chances they have to win on Fridays. They can't wait for Fridays; therefore my attendance is not so bad, because if you aren't here then you can't win. The kids do their homework more so than last year or first semester. One student in my class writes slower. I keep a photocopier in my class that helps him. There are days when he can keep up, but it's a struggle for him. Some days he tries so hard, and he just can't, so I tell him just to sit there and pay attention and we'll get the notes photocopied. Now he knows that if he's not able to keep up, he can sit down and relax and ask questions, if need be. I know he's learning, because when I ask a question, he'll answer in Mi'kmaq. So whose language am I going to evaluate him on, the language where he is perfectly correct or the language where he has no understanding of the big terms or words? When he tells me in Mi'kmaq, he knows his stuff, so I don't dwell too much on his expression in English. As long as he can answer in Mi'kmaq, that's all I want. I know he's learning.},

The videos were created for a YouTube channel specifically developed for a marketing course. Despite the potential of YouTube as a learning tool in education, its use as a learning instrument for learner-generated content is scarce. In this project, students could voluntarily participate in the creation of videos, which were then uploaded to the channel by the professors. At the end of the course, students completed a questionnaire assessing learning outcomes and satisfaction. The findings showed that active participation had a direct influence on the perceived acquisition of cross-curricular competencies and on academic performance. While participation did not directly increase subjective learning or satisfaction with the course, it had an indirect influence through cross-curricular competencies. This research contributes to previous literature by showing how learner-generated content and the use of YouTube as a teaching vehicle has a positive impact on students' learning outcomes and satisfaction.

  abstract = {Current pressures in higher education around student employability are driving new initiatives for change. Assessment is also a topic of debate, as it is a key driver of student behaviour, yet often falls behind other metrics in national surveys. In addition, increasing focus on digital literacies is catalysing new appreciations of what emerging digital culture might mean for both students and staff. These three highly topical challenges were jointly explored by the University of Exeter's Collaborate project, which aimed to create employability-focused assessments enhanced by technology. By combining existing research on assessment with grounded data derived from local stakeholders, the project has developed a model for assessment design which embeds employability directly into the curriculum. Digital technologies have been aligned with this model using a "top trump'' metaphor, where key affordances of technologies are highlighted in the context of the model. This paper explores the design-based research approach taken to develop this model and associated "top trumps'', along with results from the first practical iteration. Results suggest that the model is effective in supporting the design of an "authentic'' assessment and that a targeted affordances approach can support the alignment of specific technologies with a particular pedagogic design.},

However, minoritized students are less likely to succeed online when compared to their White and Asian peers. As the student population becomes more diverse, colleges and universities have an opportunity to improve this problem by preparing faculty to design and facilitate inclusive online learning experiences that more effectively support the needs of all learners. This paper presents a model for humanized online teaching using a theoretical framework influenced by Culturally Responsive Teaching (CRT), social presence, validation theory, and Universal Design for Learning (UDL). Humanized online teaching ensures the noncognitive components of learning are addressed through instructor-student relationships and community, allowing connection and empathy to drive engagement and rigor. Six humanizing strategies with real teaching examples are discussed, in addition to goals for meaningful professional development to support the adoption of humanized online teaching.},

This project used a bespoke exam system installed on a USB-drive to deliver what would have been traditional paper-based exams in an enclosed computer-based environment that was isolated from the internet and any resources other than those provided by the lecturer. This paper looks at the two exams chosen by the Western Australian group for the trial; a programming exam for pre-service computing teachers and an occupational health and safety exam for pre-service design and technology teachers. Both groups were drawn from the Graduate Diploma in Education course at ECU. The paper looks at the nature of the exam environment and the procedure for creating e-exams. It also outlines the exam procedures used and examines the feedback provided by both the lecturers and students involved. Conclusions are drawn about the suitability of the e-exam system and improvements are recommended as well as a discussion about e-exams and digital assessment more generally.},

A total of 936 Spanish teachers from all educational levels ranging from early childhood to university participated in this nationwide survey. Four aspects were explored: (1) changes in the use of assessment instruments (e.g. exams); (2) changes in assessment criteria, standards and grading; (3) changes in the delivery of feedback and use of rubrics; and (4) changes in students' involvement in assessment (i.e. self- and peer assessment). In general, results are mixed, with some areas undergoing certain changes with the aim of adapting to the new situation (e.g. primary education teachers lowering their grading standards), whereas many other assessment practices have remained similar, especially among higher education teachers. Unfortunately, some of the assessment practices have worsened, such as students' involvement in assessment which has decreased.},

Though they have been claimed to have positive effects on students' learning, these effects have not been meta-analyzed. Our aim was to synthesize the effects of rubrics on academic performance, self-regulated learning, and self-efficacy. The moderator effect of the following variables was also investigated: year of publication, gender, mean age, educational level, type of educational level (compulsory vs. higher education), number of sessions, number of assessment criteria, number of performance levels, use of self and peer assessment, research design, and empirical quality of the study. Standardized mean differences (for the three outcomes) and standardized mean changes (SMC; for academic performance) were calculated from the retrieved studies. After correcting for publication bias, a moderate and positive effect was found in favor of rubrics on academic performance (g\,=\,0.45, k\,=\,21, m\,=\,54, 95\% CI [0.312, 0.831]; SMC\,=\,0.38, 95\% CI [0.02, 0.75], k\,=\,12, m\,=\,30), whereas a small pooled effect was observed for self-regulated learning (g\,=\,0.23, k\,=\,5, m\,=\,17, 95\% CI [-0.15, 0.60]) and for self-efficacy (g\,=\,0.18, k\,=\,3, m\,=\,5, 95\% CI [-0.81, 0.91]). Most of the moderator variables were not significant. Importantly, to improve the quality of future reports on the effects of rubrics, we provide an instrument to be filled out for rubric scholars in forthcoming studies.},

The survey was conducted during the second semester of the academic year 2016-2017 with the use of an anonymous written questionnaire which was answered by 128 undergraduate students of the Department of Primary Education of University of the Aegean. The results of the survey show that students primarily consider as the most important service for them the department's website and the service Studentsweb. The least important service for them is the communication platform uniway for mobiles. Also, the degree of satisfaction with electronic administrative services is related to the criteria: availability, ease of use, good organization, responsiveness of services to the needs and expectations of students, and the degree of information. Moreover, problems such as "Mistakes about courses' grades" and "Unsuccessful academic books' registration" appears to have a negative impact on the degree of satisfaction of students with the corresponding services in which the problems occur. The findings of this research can be useful to the administrative staff and faculty of University of the Aegean as they show the dimensions of electronic administrative services that are important and effective and satisfy or create problems for students.},

According to the main findings, self-assessment is implemented through various ways that include inter alia electronic and non-electronic self-assessment tools. Internationally, most studies have examined and proved the contribution of student self-assessment to improvement of performance and learning. Moreover, self-assessment develops self-regulating learning, increases self-confidence, motivates students to ask guidance from their professors and help from their peers, increases self-efficacy, students' awareness of self-assessment ability and self-control, makes students change attitudes towards course, prepares employability skills of students, reduces anxiety for assessment, increases students' responsibility about their learning, makes them have a critical view on their work and develops critical thinking skills. In Greece, it was found only one study that examined the implementation of student self-assessment in Higher education and its impact on students and findings indicate that self-assessment through a quiz improves performance, self-regulation, motivates students to try more and helps them identify gaps in their learning. Student self-assessment ability and factors that affect this ability have been examined only internationally, so in Greece there is a research gap concerning these parameters. Tertiary students can self-assess accurately and this ability depends on specific factors such as confidence, prior achievement, learning style, scaffolding from professors, training, dialogical interaction and dynamic assessment.},

We totally agree with this. But we do not agree that tardiness in translating these declarations into reality can be ascribed, as it often is, to such factors as the lack of money, technology, standards or teacher training. Obviously there is need for improvement in all of those areas. But the primary lack is something very different -- a shortage of bold, coherent, inspiring yet realistic visions of what education could be like 10 and 20 years from now. What we mean by vision is not a blueprint but a compelling view of the "look and feel" of the future -- its needs, its opportunities and how we can prepare ourselves now to act on them. Vision allows us to look beyond the problems that beset us today, giving direction to our passage into the future. Even more important, vision energizes that passage by inspiring and guiding us into action.},

However, there remain significant workload barriers for instructors that impede their capacity to provide timely and meaningful feedback. The increasing role technology is playing in the education space may provide novel solutions to this impediment. As students interact with the various learning technologies in their course of study, they create digital traces that can be captured and analysed. These digital traces form the new kind of data that are frequently used in learning analytics to develop actionable recommendations that can support student learning. This paper explores the use of such analytics to address the challenges impeding the capacity of instructors to provide personalised feedback at scale. The case study reported in the paper showed how the approach was associated with a positive impact on student perception of feedback quality and on academic achievement. The study was conducted with first year undergraduate engineering students enrolled in a computer systems course with a blended learning design across three consecutive years (N2013=290, N2014=316 and N2015=415).

Through a thematic analysis using a constant comparison method, it was found that the biggest challenges instructors experienced in providing effective feedback was their own workload, the disruption that student inaction on feedback brought to the feedback process, and how the instructors managed their own affective responses and mindsets towards feedback. These findings are discussed within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and based on these findings, recommendations for instructors include considering their own limitations when designing feedback processes and checking their beliefs about feedback with their students' perspectives on feedback in order to align understanding.},

  abstract = {The term ?learning styles? refers to the concept that individuals differ in regard to what mode of instruction or study is most effective for them. Proponents of learning-style assessment contend that optimal instruction requires diagnosing individuals' learning style and tailoring instruction accordingly. Assessments of learning style typically ask people to evaluate what sort of information presentation they prefer (e.g., words versus pictures versus speech) and/or what kind of mental activity they find most engaging or congenial (e.g., analysis versus listening), although assessment instruments are extremely diverse. The most common?but not the only?hypothesis about the instructional relevance of learning styles is the meshing hypothesis, according to which instruction is best provided in a format that matches the preferences of the learner (e.g., for a ?visual learner,? emphasizing visual presentation of information).The learning-styles view has acquired great influence within the education field, and is frequently encountered at levels ranging from kindergarten to graduate school. There is a thriving industry devoted to publishing learning-styles tests and guidebooks for teachers, and many organizations offer professional development workshops for teachers and educators built around the concept of learning styles.The authors of the present review were charged with determining whether these practices are supported by scientific evidence. We concluded that any credible validation of learning-styles-based instruction requires robust documentation of a very particular type of experimental finding with several necessary criteria. First, students must be divided into groups on the basis of their learning styles, and then students from each group must be randomly assigned to receive one of multiple instructional methods. Next, students must then sit for a final test that is the same for all students. Finally, in order to demonstrate that optimal learning requires that students receive instruction tailored to their putative learning style, the experiment must reveal a specific type of interaction between learning style and instructional method: Students with one learning style achieve the best educational outcome when given an instructional method that differs from the instructional method producing the best outcome for students with a different learning style. In other words, the instructional method that proves most effective for students with one learning style is not the most effective method for students with a different learning style.Our review of the literature disclosed ample evidence that children and adults will, if asked, express preferences about how they prefer information to be presented to them. There is also plentiful evidence arguing that people differ in the degree to which they have some fairly specific aptitudes for different kinds of thinking and for processing different types of information. However, we found virtually no evidence for the interaction pattern mentioned above, which was judged to be a precondition for validating the educational applications of learning styles. Although the literature on learning styles is enormous, very few studies have even used an experimental methodology capable of testing the validity of learning styles applied to education. Moreover, of those that did use an appropriate method, several found results that flatly contradict the popular meshing hypothesis.We conclude therefore, that at present, there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning-styles assessments into general educational practice. Thus, limited education resources would better be devoted to adopting other educational practices that have a strong evidence base, of which there are an increasing number. However, given the lack of methodologically sound studies of learning styles, it would be an error to conclude that all possible versions of learning styles have been tested and found wanting; many have simply not been tested at all. Further research on the use of learning-styles assessment in instruction may in some cases be warranted, but such research needs to be performed appropriately.},

Specifically, I examine how educators are bringing elements of openness into their everyday teaching and learning practice using educational technologies.

This approach positions technologies as being continually socially constructed, interpreted, and put into practice. In an organizational context, the use of technology is intrinsically linked with institutional properties, rules and norms, as well as individual perceptions and knowledge. The findings suggest that OEP represents an emerging form of learning design, which draws from existing models of constructivist and networked pedagogy. Open technologies are being used to support and enable active learning experiences, presenting and sharing learners work in real-time, allowing for formative feedback, peer review, and ultimately, promoting community-engaged coursework. By designing learning in this way, faculty offer learners an opportunity to consider and practice developing themselves as public citizens and develop the knowledge and literacies for working with copyright and controlling access to their online contributions, while presenting options for extending some of those rights to others.

  abstract = {To date, the phenomenon associated with open education in relation to teaching and learning practices remains under-theorized in the literature, which represents both a challenge and opportunity for further research (Bulfin et al., 2013; Howard \& Maton, 2011; Knox, 2013; Veletsianos, 2015). There exists an opportunity to develop new theory, as well as to connect the phenomenon to existing theory from education, learning sciences, and pedagogical research. Much of the literature has focused on case studies, strategies for implementation, and broad approaches to institutional change which do not draw upon or develop theory. A significant amount of the empirical work reviewed makes no mention of a theoretical base aside from that of openness as a conceptual framework for considering education. Further, critical studies which examine the pedagogical and educational implications of the use of open educational resources (OER) and engagement in open educational practices (OEP) are even less common (Knox, 2013). In this paper, we share the results of a literature review which investigates both methodological and theoretical approaches used in the available research on open educational practices, with the goal of engaging participants in a critical review of the theoretical and methodological approaches to further advance research in this emerging space.},

While previous research into grading has focused primarily on the reliability and composition of teachers' grades as well as the predictive and concurrent validity of grades, our research explores the ways teachers negotiate grades within a dilemmatic space. Specifically, the purpose of this study is to examine teachers' negotiated responses to classroom grading dilemmas. Data were collected from Canadian and Swiss secondary teachers through qualitative methods: interviews, focus groups, and writing reflections. Through inductive thematic analysis, results identified five themes that emerged from the articulation of grading dilemmas which collective characterize the dilemmatic space for teacher grading: (a) fairness, (b) justification of grading decisions and communication, (b) teacher investment, (d) commitments to learning, and (e) validity of grading systems for learning system. Collectively, these results hold implications for teacher assessment education and grading theory, specifically the consideration of grading as a cross-cultural phenomenon and grading as a dilemmatic space.},

Examples will show that the term itself is now used beyond its apparent, stated scope, that it is used in a number of varied ways, and that this is in itself problematic. The ways in which the term is used will be identified, and from these a strategic categorisation to rethink the use of the single term in areas of scholarship (particularly research and teaching) will be proposed, offering terms specifically encompassing the realms in which technologies are being used. From this categorisation, it will be shown that each specific category is based on different conceptions related to or arising from practice. Consequently, ways that theoretical backgrounds should be considered will be explored in each case. While existing theoretical backgrounds enable conceptual underpinnings in some of those cases, in other cases it will be shown that there are currently no fully developed theories or limited theoretical frameworks available. The paper will conclude by identifying key research areas needed if we are to develop and take pertinent aspects of scholarship further forward.},

Over the years, an extensive body of literature has been produced regarding principles and practice guidelines for the assessment of students' learning outcomes. However, what are students' conceptions of assessment? The present article, given the strong drive to understand the role that conceptions have in educational practices, focuses on students' conceptions of assessment within the Italian higher education system. More specifically, this paper reports on a research study realised through the administration of the Students' Conceptions of Assessment Inventory (SCoA). The data were analysed using a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) design. This study represents a useful step in understanding conceptions that students have of assessment within the framework of quality assurance. Results of the study may set the groundwork for a critical debate on changes and improvements in the higher education field.},

The format of the conference, expert panel meetings and workshops to revise or develop new clinical assessment tools, as described in the methodology paper, evolved from previous consensus meetings with several new components. Apart from this consensus statement, the conference process yielded revised tools including the Concussion Recognition Tool-6 (CRT6) and Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-6 (SCAT6, Child SCAT6), as well as a new tool, the Sport Concussion Office Assessment Tool-6 (SCOAT6, Child SCOAT6). This consensus process also integrated new features including a focus on the para athlete, the athlete's perspective, concussion-specific medical ethics and matters related to both athlete retirement and the potential long-term effects of SRC, including neurodegenerative disease. This statement summarises evidence-informed principles of concussion prevention, assessment and management, and emphasises those areas requiring more research.},

We collated quantitative data on engagement with each video resource through the Learning Management System, drew further insights from an online survey of the students and combined this with data obtained from an institutional student evaluation survey. Whilst there has been much research conducted about the use of video lectures and other online resources, there has been little research conducted specifically with IT students to determine their preferences when selecting learning resources. We report the preferences of IT undergraduate students when provided with a selection of video learning materials, how the resources were used and their perceived learning value. This study not only offers a set of considerations and recommendations for the design of learning materials for IT students, but also for digital learning in higher-education more generally. Short premium videos were watched many more times than full lectures, and 85\% of students agreed that short premium videos were more beneficial and effective than longer, lower quality lecture recordings for their learning. The students' self-assessed video attention span varied greatly, with a mean of 10 minutes. Students perceived that short premium videos helped them to retain knowledge. However, the perceived most useful resource overall was the lecture slides.},

We also describe late professor Mika Sepp{\"a}l{\"a}'s seminal work at the University of Helsinki to develop online materials and tools for learning mathematics since 2001.

This intensive work evolved into a complete online English Calculus curriculum starting from the Fall 2013 and soon recognized as an alternative route for taking traditional university Calculus courses in Helsinki. Automatic assessment systems of mathematical competencies, such as STACK and WeBWorK, can take a student's answer as a mathematical object, e.g. a function or an equation, and check whether it satisfies the requirements set for a correct answer as well as give immediate and meaningful feedback. That is a powerful tool especially for formative assessment: log data shows that many students prefer to start with quizzes and when necessary, consult lecturing materials.},

The policy cycle revolves quicker than the research cycle, with the result that `real time' evaluations often have little influence on policy making. As a result, the quest for evidence-based policy has turned increasingly to systematic reviews of the results of previous inquiries in the relevant policy domain. However, this shifting of the temporal frame for evaluation is in itself no guarantee of success. Evidence, whether new or old, never speaks for itself. Accordingly, there is debate about the best strategy of marshalling bygone research results into the policy process. This article joins the imbroglio by examining the logic of the two main strategies of systematic review: `meta-analysis' and `narrative review'. Whilst they are often presented as diametrically opposed perspectives, this article argues that they share common limitations in their understanding of how to provide a template for impending policy decisions. This review provides the background for Part II of the article (to be published in the next issue, Evaluation 8[3]), which considers the merits of a new model for evidence-based policy, namely `realist synthesis'.},

  year = {2007},
  abstract = {The impetus for this study was my own curiosity about how seasoned entrepreneurial women were able to stay the course. As someone who has experienced the world of the employee and that of the entrepreneur, my goal was to better understand how, within their varied personal contexts, the lifelong learning experiences of seasoned entrepreneurial women were shaped by socio-cultural influences, significant individuals, gender, and learning challenges. Theories and research on lifelong and biographical learning, entrepreneurial learning, women's learning, and entrepreneurial women's learning helped to frame the study. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews and focus groups with eight women entrepreneurs between the ages of 40 and 60, with 16 to 30 years' experience in running their service-oriented enterprise were conducted. These women's stories illustrate how serendipitous their careers were, that is, they did not begin their working lives thinking they would become entrepreneurs, rather, it became the path that best supported their desires, independence and creativity. They were shaped by and sometimes resisted parents' messages about the role that education, work and marriage with children should play in women's lives. How they faced and learned from adversity and from the support of business mentors and friends were also significant. As they reflected back on their lives, they have a strong sense of mastery. Success for them did not focus on finances, rather, their autonomy, freedom, and control over the direction of their lives and the development of strong caring relationships with others, were key. Their learning was dynamic and experiential, it was both self directed and drew on others' knowledge. Women contemplating an entrepreneurial path may find this study of interest as they can learn how others, particularly family, shape their dreams, how they might meet challenges and learn from adversity, and overall, how central lifelong learning is to the development of their entrepreneurial careers. Educators and policymakers need to appreciate the serendipitous nature of entrepreneurship, how they can create entrepreneurial experiences for students, and expose the learners to not only essential skills required to run a business, but also to the stories regarding the self-development of successful entrepreneurs},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Action research as a form of professional development encourages teachers to participate in cycles of planning, acting, observing and reflecting, thereby creating possibilities for change and transformation. Equally important are the transformations and professional growth experienced by the facilitator in an action research context. In recent literature, the epistemological and methodological foundations of action research have come under scrutiny. Part of this debate emerges from the experience of those who actually attempt to facilitate action research with groups of teachers. In this paper I critically examine my participation (as a university?based facilitator and researcher) in an action research group in science, technology and society (STS) education to illustrate: (a) how a second?order inquiry enhanced my understanding of the nature of action research, while (b) simultaneously allowing me to explore and develop strategies for facilitating the process.},

Although several studies value the importance of technologies in our media-enriched world and the "learn anytime and anywhere" motto associated with mobile learning, we argue that the classroom dynamics are becoming more and more at risk with the addictive dimension brought about by the ubiquitous presence of digital devices and social media in students' lives. In this article, we will make a critical review of the literature related to mobile learning because there is still a need of more extensive research on the interference of technology in the classroom, especially on how multitasking affects the teacher role in-class as a media orchestrator and learning facilitator. Finally, we will discuss the use of technology in the formal classroom environment, mainly to stimulate a much-needed discussion about the bright-not-so-bright impacts of technology in the teaching and learning process.},

Exploring the capacity of this sector to adapt in the state of uncertainty has become more significant than ever. In this paper, we critically reflect on our experience of teaching urban design research methods online during the early COVID-19 lockdown in the UK. This is an exploratory case study with a qualitative approach with an aim to inform resilient practices of teaching in the face of public health emergencies. Drawing on the experience of teaching the Research Methods and Techniques subject during lockdown, we discuss the rapid transition from face-to-face to online teaching and point to the challenges and opportunities in relation to the learning and teaching activities, assessment and feedback, and digital platforms. This paper concludes by outlining some key considerations to inform the development of more adaptive and resilient approaches to online teaching in the context of unprecedented global health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We argue that it is critical to move beyond fixed pedagogical frameworks to harness the productive capacities of adaptive teaching.},

This systematic review presents a variety of studies that provide qualitative and/or quantitative data to investigate the current practices with VR support focusing on students' outcomes, performance, alongside with the benefits and challenges of this technology concerning the analysis of visual features and design elements with mobile and desktop computing devices in different learning subjects. During the selection and screening process, forty-six ( n =\,46) articles published from the middle of 2009 until the middle of 2020 were finally included for a detailed analysis and synthesis of which twenty-one and twenty-five in K-12 and HE, respectively. The majority of studies were focused on describing and evaluating the appropriateness or the effectiveness of the applied instructional design processes using various VR applications to disseminate their findings on user experience, usability issues, students' outcomes, and/or learning performance. This study contributes by reviewing how instructional design strategies and techniques can potentially benefit students' learning performance using a wide range of VR applications. It also proposes some recommendations to guide and lead effective instructional design settings in several teaching and learning contexts to outline a more accurate and up-to-date picture of the current state of literature.},

In a survey study from two universities in Indonesia, we assess how the machine teacher Wiley Daila affects the teaching and learning environment. The findings indicate that among users of Daila, Daila is perceived as useful and increases perceived teaching effectiveness and student learning outcomes. This study therefore suggests the potential of even basal machine teachers to assist in enhancing student learning.},

Using sequential mixed-methods in a quasi-experimental design, 68 pre-service teachers in the 3rd year of a Bachelor of Education (B.Ed) program were surveyed before and after virtual learning interventions. This phase was followed by qualitative data gathering using focus group interviews with all participants. Findings from quantitative data analysis revealed a positive significant difference in pre-service teachers' attitudes towards virtual laboratory experiments post learning interventions. From qualitative data pre-service teachers found the progression from using only traditional to including virtual experiments was useful in enhancing their conceptual understandings of Life Sciences concepts, convenience, inquiry-based learning, self-directed and autonomous learning. However, pre-service teachers noted that using virtual laboratories did not significantly develop their science process skills and as a result could not replace the experiences in a traditional biology laboratory. The implications of these findings project virtual laboratories as a supporting tool for experimentation in Life Sciences especially within and post the COVID-19 pandemic where issues of social distancing pose a threat to collaborative and inquiry-based science learning. Recommendations from these findings are discussed herein.},

  abstract = {Institutions of higher education face an increasing demand for evidence that they are providing the high-quality educational experience promised in promotional materials. Accrediting bodies require assessment for accountability to ensure continuous improvement. Faculty at Christian higher education institutions join their secular counterparts in questioning the value of time-consuming assessment activities, disconnected from meaningful teaching designed to fulfill distinctly Christian missions, often understood as ``the integration of faith and learning.'' In 2016, Paul Kaak, faith integration editor of Christian Higher Education, called for ``explorers and cartographers'' to devise more detailed maps of academic faith integration leading to learning in all disciplines that is carried out ``in the light of faith'' (p. 189). This essay answers that call for an integration roadmap as it relates to assessment, planting signposts grounded in Reformed epistemology and framing it as science and story. Three key principles shape the argument: (a) educational assessment constitutes a God-designed natural act of human knowing and valuing, though finite and distorted by sin; (b) human fallibility necessitates assessment processes that are characterized by transparency, enabling learners to use their gifts for God's glory; and (c) assessment is most effective when enacted in a loving community of learners who recognize that performance does not determine worth in God's eyes. Finally, the article concludes with practical guidelines to implement a Christian vision of assessment.},

Drawing specifically on examples of curricular activity systems that highlight social dimensions of learning, we analyze variations in ways research teams articulate the three vertices of the ``assessment triangle.'' We introduce two additional important dimensions that emphasize the social dimensions of learning: (1) how each model justifies the importance of particular goals for learning and (2) how each conceptualizes the relationship between becoming proficient in a domain and appropriating disciplinary dispositions, tools, and practices. We present brief analyses of three different multi-year assessment projects to illustrate our framework followed by a comparative synthesis. In the concluding part of the chapter, we argue for the need for assessment developers to consider further some aspects of sociocultural perspectives on learning not yet reflected fully in contemporary assessments for learning.},

The second part presents results according to the main emerging themes arising from data analysis: assessment methods, modes of assessment and assessment related to a given teaching and learning method. The paper concludes that the foci of the studies are aligned with assessment practices other than the written test, in accordance with a learner-oriented perspective. Although the implementation of the Bologna process has had different kinds of impact in different European countries, the review shows that the use and effects of a diversity of assessment methods in higher education have been investigated, particularly those pointing to the so-called alternative methods.

This study uses a digital rubric to assess oral presentation competence in different situations of progressive assessment for 99 preservice teachers, situations in which participation was either optional or compulsory. Findings show that the digital rubric used at various times is a methodology and a technology that facilitates the feedback process and dialogue between teachers and students about the assessment criteria. The results support future decisions for methodological design of formative assessment appropriate to online learning environments.},

There are emerging studies that explore their effectiveness, but less so with respect to their use in the online second language classroom. This study explores the effectiveness of word clouds for teaching English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in an asynchronous mode. The study used a mixed methods design and triangulation was used for data collection. The participant group, as bachelor's degree students at the Virtual University of Pakistan (VUP), were given word clouds based assessment activities in two communication skills courses: Eng 001 (305 students participated) and Eng 101 (1714 and 1516 students participated in two activities respectively). The scores of the students were analyzed to gauge the suitability of task-based assessment in an asynchronous mode. Furthermore, an online survey questionnaire was administered to seek their input on the assessment activities. A total of 272 (N= 272) students responded to the survey questionnaire. The results reflected that the students responded positively overall regarding the use of word clouds for reading comprehension and essay writing tasks but had mixed opinions about reading and writing skill improvement tasks. The study concludes that the use of word clouds for pre-reading and pre-writing activities for task-based EFL teaching in asynchronous learning environments can be effective with the constraints that are described.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented challenge for wider society and has impacted all facets of life, including Higher Education Institution (HEIs) provision for teaching and learning -- demanding an immediate digital response. The core challenge lies with the inherent choice made by students upon embarking on an undergraduate degree; that face-to-face learning was their preference. Now, HEIs must address this by utilising a range of digital solutions -- that crucially, must also be embraced by those that no longer have the luxury to be risk averse or believe that digital solutions align with their existing pedagogical approaches. Higher Education Institutions should be -- to an extent -- well placed to deliver online provision. This paper aims to explore pertinent literature surrounding blended approaches with regards to key pedagogical and learning theories, with an overall aim of suggesting the Online and Campus (OaC) model as a potential 'blueprint' that incorporates campus, synchronous and asynchronous learning experiences. We refer to asynchronous as flexible, self-paced learning, and synchronous as an environment in which learners are in the same place at a given time (either online or campus) and accessing the same materials. For the purposes of this paper -- and the OaC model -- both asynchronous and synchronous learning refers to online provision, and we make the distinction between face-to-face teaching by reference to 'Campus'.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the effects of using online formative assessments on students' learning achievements. Using a quasi-experimental study design with one control group (no formative assessments available), and two experimental groups receiving feedback in available online formative assessments (knowledge of the correct response - KCR, or elaborated feedback - EF), it was investigated how feedback type in combination with learning content complexity will affect students' learning achievements when used in-vivo, in a digital signal processing university course. Data generated by the two experimental groups was additionally used to investigate differences in using online formative assessments based on the feedback type. Study findings suggest online formative assessments are a very efficient educational intervention for this domain. The acquired data suggests that students quickly recognized the value of the formative assessments and that more than 90\% of students have used them extensively. Statistically significant improvements in learning achievements were observed in the KCR group compared to the control group (p {$<$} 0.01, Cohen's d between 0.691 and 1.080, depending on the learning content complexity), and KCR group compared to the EF group (p {$<$} 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.877, in the case of most complex of the three learning contents used). No statistically significant differences were found in formative assessment usage between the two experimental groups, aside from the difference in the time between consecutive formative assessment attempts, indicating students did make use of the available feedback. Reported results are significant for demonstrating the potential of online formative assessments in achieving the desired learning outcomes in higher education, as well as for gaining insights into students' habits of using them.},

The online teaching model measures candidates' ability to apply technology standards in order to design, implement, and assess learning experiences to engage students and improve learning. In order to pass the Online Teaching Module, candidates must score 3 out of 4 possible points on at least five of the six indicators. If a candidate does not pass this assessment, goals will be created along with strategies to require the candidate to improve on area(s) of weakness in technology use. After the strategies have been implemented, the candidate will be able to redo this key assessment. Candidates will not be able to progress to student teaching without passing this assessment. This paper outlines this key assessment's administration, purpose, instructions, and rubric. We hope it will be useful to others as they prepare for CAEP visits.},

The interviewees were those who directly involved in the self-assessment processes including institutional leaders, department heads, faculty deans, internal quality assurance staff and lecturers. Thematic analysis identified that there was a number of notable impacts resulting from the implementation of self-assessment on higher education quality. Key impacts were reported in relation to: leadership and management, teaching staff, students and student support, and training programs. The study concludes that self-assessment processes had a positive impact on improving the quality of teaching, learning, program management and student support in Vietnamese universities sampled for the current study.},

The questionnaires were used to gather the information concerning students' and teachers' perceptions towards the overall features of the assessment tools and their effectiveness. The participants consisted of 103 students and 5 teachers. The findings showed that both teachers and students generally place a higher value on traditional assessment tools especially in terms of their validity and reliability.

For instance, post-secondary attainment for Aboriginal peoples is still only 8\% compared to 20\% of the rest of Canada (Statistics Canada, 2008, 2013). A challenge within higher education has been creating the space within predominately Euro-Western defined and ascribed structures, academic disciplines, policies, and practices to create meaningful spaces for Indigenous peoples. Indigenization is a movement centering Indigenous knowledges and ways of being within the academy, in essence transforming institutional initiatives, such as policy, curricular and co-curricular programs, and practices to support Indigenous success and empowerment. Drawing on research projects that span the last 10 years, this article celebrates the pockets of success within institutions and identifies areas of challenge to Indigenization that moves away from the tokenized checklist response, that merely tolerates Indigenous knowledge(s), to one where Indigenous knowledge(s) are embraced as part of the institutional fabric.},

Governments and university administration measure success through graduation rates. While the economic and social benefits of a university education are also important to Aboriginal people, successful negotiation of mainstream higher education also entails maintaining their cultural integrity (Tierney \& Jun, 2001). Broadening notions of success and corresponding retention theories is important to move forward the agenda of Aboriginal higher education. The purpose of this article is to further the theoretical and practical discussions of educational success of Aboriginal students. Using social reproduction theory and a post-colonial framework, this article presents an argument that shows how/why conventional discourses on retention and student success often exclude Indigenous understandings and worldviews. To this end, it provides a counter-hegemonic on current discourses relating to retention and Aboriginal persistence in mainstream institutions. The article concludes with some thoughts on how to enrich the educational experiences of Aboriginal students from an Indigenous understanding of success and retention.}

However, proportion of item related to formative assessment, classroom culture, and collaboration in instruments of assessment literacy were somewhat increased under the influence of curriculum revision.

  abstract = {In this paper, we applied a peer assessment scenario at the Technical University of Manab{\'i} (Ecuador). Students and professors evaluated some works through rubrics, assigned a numerical score, and provided textual feedback grounding why such a numerical score was determined, to detect inaccuracy between both assessments. The proposed model uses soft computing techniques to reduce the professor's workload in the correction process. Experiments were carried out with a data set in the Spanish language. We applied a supervised machine learning approach to obtain a sentiment score corresponding to specific textual feedback, and the fuzzy logic approach to detect inaccuracy between numerical and sentiment scores and obtain the assessment score. The results showed that the support vector machine model had a better performance with low computational costs when the feedback was represented as a 1-g and 2-g vector, whose relevance was weighted with term frequency-inverse document frequency; moreover, the grader's critical judgment validity was inferred from the similarities between numerical and sentiment scores. At the end, the outcomes assert the model is reliable and guarantees a fair peer assessment procedure.},

As initially negotiated with students, feedback was learner-centred and involved a formative intervention approach applied iteratively by the teacher educator over the course of one semester. Although such feedback was initially face-to-face, it had to be given exclusively online following the unexpected closure of the university. Analysis of student teachers' perspectives, which were collected through an online questionnaire completed after their final assessment, reveals both positive and critical aspects regarding the feedback provided by the teacher educator. While reaffirming the significance of feedback as a crucial element for learning in online teacher education contexts, the findings also show that the clarity, affective bonding and multimodal meaning-making involved in face-to-face interaction are particularly challenging when the communication of feedback is digitally mediated. The implications and limitations of such findings are discussed.},

'Good thinking' and 'thinking well' are commonly used terms bound up with what is called 'critical thinking' in the research literature. Evidence is presented in this paper, however, which suggests that not all students may be good at critical thinking; nor do some teachers appear to teach students 'good thinking' skills. A review of the research literature in this area was undertaken and the methods and conceptions of teaching likely to inhibit and enhance critical thinking are outlined, as well as what is required to improve students' thinking skills. Ways forward in teaching critical thinking, and in helping students to learn to think well and for themselves, are described and discussed.

The three modes of interrelated social learning activities include: (1) authoring the written ePortfolio in an online ePortfolio digital media platform, (2) presenting the ePortfolio in the webinar platform, and (3) presenting the ePortfolio in-person in a physical setting. We used case study methodology to systematically investigate how each participant used their ePortfolio capstone exit project to engage the Association of College and Research Libraries' (2015) Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (ACRL Framework) as a conceptual lens to document their competencies (as part of reflective practice) in information literacy. The unit of analysis we used was the ePortfolio entry focused on using information literacy to understand science education theory and practice. Findings show that the participants emphasized content in different but connected communication modes across the ePortfolio social pedagogy ecosystem. Findings also show that ePortfolio is an effective tool for self-assessment and reflection on one's information literacy competencies. Implications for outcomes assessment are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Reflection is widely accepted as a learning tool and is considered integral to professional practice. Journal writing is advocated in facilitating reflection, yet little is written about how to assess reflection in journals. The purpose of this study was to develop and test a method of assessing the elements of reflection in journals and to determine whether, and to what level, reflection occurs in journals. Twenty-seven physical therapy students maintained written reflective journals throughout three of their four eight-week clinical affiliations. The students were introduced to concepts of reflective practice with definitions of terms and reflective questions before their second affiliation. A coding schema was developed to assess the journals. Three raters assessed forty-three journals. The text of each journal was analyzed for evidence of nine elements of reflection, and each journal was categorized as showing no evidence of reflection, evidence of reflection, or evidence of critical reflection. Descriptive statistics were used to demonstrate evidence of reflection. Reliability between each pair of raters was assessed using percent agreement, phi coefficients, and gamma statistics. Interrater reliability of all raters was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC[2,1]). Results showed that the raters assessed 95.3\%-100\% of the journals as showing at least one element of reflection. The percent agreement between rater pairs for the nine elements of reflection ranged from 65.1\% to 93.0\%, the phi coefficient ranged from 0.08 to 0.81, and the ICC(2,1) values used to assess reliability among the three raters on each element ranged from 0.03 to 0.72. Averaging the assessment of the three raters for the overall journal, 14.7\% of the journals were assessed as showing no evidence of reflection, 43.4\% as showing evidence of reflection, and 41.9\% as showing evidence of critical reflection. The percent agreement between rater pairs for the overall assessment of the journals ranged from 67.4\% to 85.7\%, the gamma statistic ranged from 0.88 to 0.98, and the ICC(2,1) among all raters was 0.74 (95\% confidence interval, 0.61-0.84). These results represent an acceptable level of agreement for use of this method of assessment for educational purposes. The coding schema developed provides a mechanism to assess evidence of reflection in written journals, which will enable instructors to evaluate student competency, obtain a baseline for facilitating reflective practice, and assess their own efficacy in facilitating reflection among students.}

  abstract = {Formative feedback has great potential for teaching and learning in online undergraduate programmes. There is a large number of courses where the main source of feedback is provided by the instructor. This is particularly seen in subjects where assessments are designed based on specific activities which are the same for all students, and where the assessment is performed by the instructor, not by a peer. Additionally, in introductory or basically procedural courses, there is often a need for instructor feedback, as opposed to peer-feedback, as it demands high quality feedback both in the content and in the process in order not to mislead students. Therefore personalized feedback provided by instructor is an academic demand in the current educational models that have positioned the student at the center of the learning process. However in the present context of high student-staff ratio, it is not easy to extend the use of individual comments delivered by instructors among the academic community. This article focuses on the virtual higher education environment given its present and future potential as well as the amount of queries currently surrounding it. Literature on formative feedback in higher education has been reviewed for the period 2000 to 2014, in order to find answers as to which aspects are relevant to efficiently implement personalized feedback prepared by the teacher. Findings show that effective personalized feedback in an virtual environment requires a three-dimensional analysis: from the student perspective, from the instructor one and from the media perspective (written text, video recording or audio recording) , in order to find shared aspects that contribute to the enhancement in the use of personalized feedback performed by faculty.},

We find that these datasets are overwhelmingly composed of lighter-skinned subjects (79.6\% for IJB-A and 86.2\% for Adience) and introduce a new facial analysis dataset which is balanced by gender and skin type. We evaluate 3 commercial gender classification systems using our dataset and show that darker-skinned females are the most misclassified group (with error rates of up to 34.7\%). The maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8\%. The substantial disparities in the accuracy of classifying darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males in gender classification systems require urgent attention if commercial companies are to build genuinely fair, transparent and accountable facial analysis algorithms.},

The purpose of this study was to examine the motivational factors that influence the acceptance of the Peer Assessment Collaboration Evaluation (PACE) Tool among faculty employed at a mid-sized university in the Southeastern United States. This study used Davis's (1986) technology acceptance model (TAM) and motivational constructs "attitude toward using, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use" (p. 44). The researcher used simple linear regression and standard multiple regression to determine if there was a significant relationship, if any, between the motivational constructs. The results of the linear regressions denoted positive, significant relationships between perceived ease of use of the PACE Tool and attitude toward using the PACE Tool, perceived usefulness of the PACE Tool and attitude toward using the PACE Tool; and perceived ease of use of the PACE Tool and perceived usefulness of the PACE Tool. The results of the multiple regression indicated that both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of the PACE Tool were positively, significantly related to attitude toward using the PACE Tool. Through faculty members' speculations, the researcher was able to measure their motivation to use the PACE Tool. The results of this study demonstrated faculty members are motivated to use the PACE Tool, which indicates high acceptability and potential usage in the future. By understanding how faculty members perceive the PACE Tool, designers may be able to develop online peer-assessment tools that are more acceptable.},

The Department of Anatomy Faculty of Medicine at the University of Warmia and Mazury developed and introduced an application for tablet devices which has been implemented in student examinations and assessments, called the tablet-assisted objective structured spotter practical examination. It was created to simplify the educational process and to build a rich learning environment, facilitating deep learning for students through examination and feedback data. The method consists of cadaver stations with traditional corresponding pin spotters in an expanded tablet application. It not only provides instant feedback on various observations of teaching--learning skills but has also positively affected the entire process of education. The method provides an unbiased evaluation of knowledge and understanding of the anatomy course, ensuring objectivity and standardization. The current study was performed on a total of 608 first-year medical students in Polish and English divisions and focused on the observed advantages since the new method was introduced. Outcomes indicate that after the implementation of the method for both the Polish and English divisions' first-year medical students, the mean score of examinations significantly increased compared to other teaching--learning methods. The study highlights that students were excited about the implementation of the new method and identified its many benefits. It is recognized that technological development and the digital environment offer a range of opportunities and added value versus traditional assessment activities, methods, and processes.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of online graduate programs, and more recently, higher education institutions' moves to online interactions due to the COVID-19 crisis, have led to graduate student mentoring increasingly occurring online. Challenges, strategies, and outcomes associated with online mentoring of graduate students are of primary importance for the individuals within a mentoring dyad and for universities offering online or blended graduate education. The nature of mentoring interactions within an online format presents unique challenges and thus requires strategies specifically adapted to such interactions. There is a need to examine how mentoring relationships have been, and can best be, conducted when little to no face-to-face interaction occurs. This paper undertook a literature review of empirical studies from the last two decades on online master's and doctoral student mentoring. The main themes were challenges, strategies and best practices, and factors that influence the online mentoring relationship. The findings emphasized the importance of fostering interpersonal aspects of the mentoring relationship, ensuring clarity of expectations and communications as well as competence with technologies, providing access to peer mentor groups or cohorts, and institutional support for online faculty mentors. Within these online mentoring relationships, the faculty member becomes the link to an otherwise absent yet critical experience of academia for the online student, making it imperative to create and foster an effective relationship based on identified strategies and best practices for online mentoring.},

Due to the current focus on accountability assessments, it is in teachers' best interest, and also the students', that teachers develop a level of understanding in assessment. Assessment, when used appropriately, is also a powerful tool for learning. What is needed to facilitate assessment literacy in teacher education is more than a brief mention of assessment in a course. A course in assessment with an appropriate text is necessary to bring a more complete understanding of assessment to beginning teachers.},

  abstract = {The ability to develop new skills and competencies is a central concept of lifelong learning. Research to date has largely focused on the processes and support individuals require to engage in upskilling, re-learning or training. However, there has been limited attention examining the types of support that are necessary to assist a learner's transition from ``old'' workplace contexts to ``new''. Professionals often undergo significant restructuring of their knowledge, skills, and identities as they transition between career roles, industries, and sectors. Domains such as learning analytics (LA) have the potential to support learners as they use the analysis of fine-grained data collected from education technologies. However, we argue that to support transitions throughout lifelong learning, LA needs fundamentally new analytical and methodological approaches. To enable insights, research needs to capture and explain variability, dynamics, and causal interactions between different levels of individual development, at varying time scales. Scholarly conceptions of the context in which transitions occur are also required. Our interdisciplinary argument builds on the synthesis of literature about transitions in the range of disciplinary and thematic domains such as conceptual change, shifts between educational systems, and changing roles during life course. We highlight specific areas in research designs and current analytical methods that hinder insight into transformational changes during transitions. The paper concludes with starting points and frameworks that can advance research in this area.},

  abstract = {Annotating a text while reading is commonplace and essentially as old as printed text itself. Collaborative online annotation platforms are enabling this process in new ways, turning reading from a solitary into a collective activity. The platforms provide a critical discussion forum for students and instructors that is directly content-linked, and can increase uptake of assigned reading. However, the student viewpoint regarding collaborative online annotation platforms remains largely unexplored, as do comparisons between annotation and traditional reading assessment methods, and comparisons between the two leading platforms (Hypothes.is vs. Perusall) for annotation by the same student population. The results in this study indicate that collaborative online annotation is largely preferred by students over a traditional reading assessment approach, that students regularly exceed annotation requirements indicated by an instructor, and that overall annotation quality increased as the students gained experience with the platforms. The data analysis in this study can serve as a practical exemplar for measurement of student annotation output, where baselines have yet to be established. These findings link the established research areas of peer learning, formative assessment, and asynchronous learning, with an emerging educational technology.},

Although this is inherently a model selection problem, a model selection perspective is rarely adopted for this task. We suggest that Cudeck and Henly's (1991) framework can be applied to guide the selection process. Researchers must first identify the analytic goal: identifying the (approximately) correct m or identifying the most replicable m. Second, researchers must choose fit indices that are most congruent with their goal. Consistent with theory, a simulation study showed that different fit indices are best suited to different goals. Moreover, model selection with one goal in mind (e.g., identifying the approximately correct m) will not necessarily lead to the same number of factors as model selection with the other goal in mind (e.g., identifying the most replicable m). We recommend that researchers more thoroughly consider what they mean by ?the right number of factors? before they choose fit indices.},

The game is based on a 3D representation of the computer science and information technologies department at the Kharkiv Aviation Institute. The quest challenges are designed to measure applicants' and first-year students' digital competency. The theoretical foundation, software tools, development stages, implementation obstacles, and gaming application scenario were all used in the article. The game scenario includes a virtual tour of a 3D university department. In terms of how closely the game resembles real-life stuff, applicants can examine the department's equipment and classrooms. The team used C\# and C++, Unity 3D, and Source Engine to create the game application. We used Hammer Editor, Agisoft PhotoScan Pro, and photogrammetry technology to model objects for realistic gaming. Based on the Digital Competence Framework for Citizens (DigComp 2.2), players can assess their digital competences in a variety of ways, including a test activity, a puzzle, assembling a computer, and putting up an IT-specialist firm. The experiment conducted at the online open house day 2020 demonstrated the efficiency of the 3D quest game. A 3D quest was rated as a more modern and appealing kind of involvement by the candidates. According to the 3D quest findings, applicants displayed an average degree of digital competence, with certain specific item challenges graded at 0.5. Several psychometric item parameters were thoroughly examined in order to increase the item's quality.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The purpose of this study was to compare the quality of multiple choice questions (MCQs) developed using automated item generation (AIG) versus traditional methods, as judged by a panel of experts. The quality of MCQs developed using two methods (i.e., AIG or traditional) was evaluated by a panel of content experts in a blinded study. Participants rated a total of 102 MCQs using six quality metrics and made a judgment regarding whether or not each item tested recall or application of knowledge. A Wilcoxon two-sample test evaluated differences in each of the six quality metrics rating scales as well as an overall cognitive domain judgment. No significant differences were found in terms of item quality or cognitive domain assessed when comparing the two item development methods. The vast majority of items ({$>$} 90\%) developed using both methods were deemed to be assessing higher-order skills. When compared to traditionally developed items, MCQs developed using AIG demonstrated comparable quality. Both modalities can produce items that assess higher-order cognitive skills.},

Due to state initiatives and the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) (P.L.107--110, 2002), externally mandated testing is currently seen as the primary means of driving education reform, a means through which evidence-based decisions can be made to achieve accountability, allocate resources, inform parents and taxpayers, and credential educators. This is in addition to the longstanding and widespread use of tests to determine placement of individuals in special education or gifted programs, grade-to-grade promotion, certification for graduation, allocation of scholarships and vouchers, special intervention in instructional programs, accreditation of schools, and higher education admissions. Testing, however, is only one type of educational assessment, and in the nation's schools there are a wide range of assessment practices used by teachers and other educators, the primary users of assessment information and the primary providers of learning opportunities to students. The work represented in this volume is intended to challenge our understandings of the roles of assessment in schools and to reform our perspectives on the relationships between assessment, learning, and the provision of meaningful learning opportunities.},

  abstract = {Educational tests are sometimes viewed as no more than measuring instruments, neutral indicators of learning outcomes. For more than a century, though, tests and assessments have been used in the United States to influence curriculum, allocate educational resources and opportunities, and influence classroom instructional practices (Haertel and Herman 2005). It is argued in this chapter that the idea of opportunity to learn (OTL) offers a useful lens through which to understand these many consequences of testing policies and practices, both positive and negative. Whenever assessment affects instructional content, resources, or processes, whether by design or otherwise, it is affecting OTL.After framing the interplay of assessment with conceptions of OTL in terms of (1) content taught; (2) adequacy and allocation of educational resources; and (3) teaching practices, the chapter turns to five cases that illustrate some of these intersections. First considered is the intelligence-testing movement of the early twentieth century. This was a well-intentioned but unfortunate attempt to use testing to guide more efficient resource allocation. Second is Tyler's Eight-Year Study in the 1930s. This study reflected the designers' deep understanding that neither curriculum content nor instructional practices could be changed fundamentally unless consequential examinations were changed at the same time. The third case considered is the minimum competency testing (MCT) movement of the 1970s and 1980s, which prompted litigation leading to the legal requirement that students have a fair opportunity to learn what is covered on a high school graduation test.},

  abstract = {Students with disabilities are a group for whom opportunity to learn (OTL) and educational assessment present special issues of public policy and challenges for educational research and practice. These challenges highlight both the powerful prospects for improving schools and the significant limitations inherent in current practice. One commentator has suggested that ``when read critically, special education provides the structural and cultural insights that are necessary to begin reconstructing public education for the historical conditions of the twenty-first century and, ultimately, for reconciling it with its democratic ideals'' (Skrtic 1991, 206).Children with disabilities were a group long excluded from our nation's schools. In 1974, Congress estimated that more than a million children with disabilities were not in school (Hehir and Gamm 1999; Pullin 1999). When a commitment was made to educate this population, it was embedded in a series of state and federal legal protections that define access to educational opportunity in a manner quite different from the opportunities afforded to students without disabilities. Although our system of educating students with disabilities is far from perfect in either design or implementation, examination of the treatment of students with disabilities affords a different lens for viewing the challenges associated with providing every child with a full and fair opportunity to learn utilizing appropriate and meaningful testing and assessment.Almost nine percent of the students in the country, more than six million children and youth, received special education services in 2002 under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA); almost half of these students were those placed in the category of individuals with specific learning disabilities (U.S. Department of Education 2004).},

Colleges and universities are potentially important sites of cross-cultural and cross-racial engagement and socialization, and cultural competence is arguably one of the critical skills that many higher education institutions are embracing to prepare students for our diverse, but increasingly polarized, global society. In particular, this study discusses the use of the intercultural development inventory (IDI), a cultural assessment tool that has not been validated in the U.S. for racial, ethnic, or social class differences, and which leaves out the role of structural inequalities in intercultural relationships. Findings reveal that interview data from black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) did not align with their IDI results and that the tool dismisses the complex experiences of BIPOC students. These findings jeopardize the tool's purpose and validity. Finally, this study reveals the importance of educating students about structural competence to improve empathy and understanding of a diverse student body.},

Such formative assessments can help students identify their strengths and weaknesses, and assist faculty to recognize where students are struggling and address problems immediately. But in an online virtual lab setting, formative assessment has challenges that go beyond space-time synchrony of online classroom. As we see increased enrollment in online courses, learning science needs to address the problem of formative assessment in online laboratory sessions. We developed a student team learning monitor (STLM module) in an electronic health record system to measure student engagement and actualize the social constructivist approach of Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL). Using iterative Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles in two undergraduate courses over a period of two years, we identified critical components that are required for online implementation of POGIL. We reviewed published research on POGIL classroom implementations for the last ten years and identified some common elements that affect learning gains. We present the critical components that are necessary for implementing POGIL in online lab settings, and refer to this as Cyber POGIL. Incorporating these critical components are required to determine when, how and the circumstances under which Cyber POGIL may be successfully implemented. We recommend that more online tools be developed for POGIL classrooms, which evolve from just providing synchronous communication to improved task monitoring and assistive feedback.},

These changes are not only a product of technological innovation, but also a result of new and reconceptualized values of higher education, and so we must reexamine what changes to faculty role, position and perspectives best support these new values. Drawing on the Seven Principles of Good Practice, this article visits the need for effective faculty support and development in online education. Online education has forever transformed higher education, and we are learning that quality requires flexibility and the ability to adapt to the changing demands of learners, the new promises of technology, and the new competitive landscape of higher education. If higher education is to remain competitive, we must refocus and redesign our paradigms, as well as design business processes that integrate with quality assurance models.}

The joint modeling of item responses and RTs intends to provide more information for cognitive diagnosis while item covariates can be used to predict item parameters when item calibration is not feasible in diagnostic assessments or item parameter estimation errors could be too large due to small sample sizes for calibration. In addition, the inclusion of the item covariates allows the evaluation of cognitive theories underlying the test design in item development. Model parameter estimation is explored using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. A Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted to examine the parameter recovery of the proposed model under different simulated conditions in comparison to alternative competing models. Further, the application of the proposed model is illustrated using the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012 problem-solving items modeling both item response and RT data. The study results indicate that model parameters can be well recovered using the MCMC algorithm and the explanatory CDM jointly incorporating item responses and RTs with item covariates holds promising applications in digital-based diagnostic assessments.

Correlation analyses, mediation analysis, and moderated mediation analysis was performed through R and SPSS PROCESS Macro. The results revealed that servant leadership positively correlates with followers' feedback-seeking behavior via moqi with supervisors. Moreover, these indirect effects of servant leadership were moderated by traditionality, such that servant leadership had weaker relations with feedback-seeking behavior when traditionality was higher (vs. lower).

A case study strategy was considered appropriate as this gave us the opportunity to collect information from representatives from many universities and university colleges across Norway. Lack of knowledge about alternatives to the traditional exam, and lack of knowledge as to how digital technology may be used in assessing students were the kind of challenges most often mentioned. Assessment practices may be rooted in an assessment policy, but data from a survey (29\% response rate) indicate that there is little awareness concerning this issue within Norwegian higher education institutions.},

The analysis of 137 papers through classification by relevant categories and key word mapping shows that there is little attention on higher education teachers. It also makes clear that most approaches to educators' data literacy address management and technical abilities, with less emphasis on critical, ethical and personal approaches to datafication in education. The authors conceptualize this situation as a 'complicated' approach to data literacy in the academic profession, as opposed to a complex vision which would bundle management and technical skills together with a critical, systemic approach to professional learning and data.},

It is based on a research and development project conducted from September 2013 until April 2014 at Universitas Terbuka (UT), the Indonesia Open University. The research consisted of three stages. The first stage developed the Tutorial Activity Plan (TAP) and the Tutorial Activity Unit (TAU). The second stage developed a prototype online tutorial model along with the initiation materials and tasks. The third stage was a trial implementation of online tutorials using OER. The Online tutorials were a course called Natural Resource Conservation and Environment (NRCE). Data on student learning outcomes on the completion of tasks and discussion activities were collected. Student learning outcomes were based on indicators of Enis's critical thinking skills. Student perceptions toward online tutorial activities were based on the students' assessment of the online tutorial implementation. Data were collected using a questionnaire, tests, document analysis forms, and interviews. The results indicated that critical thinking can be develop through the utilization online tutorial activities. The students utilized OER as reference source when they were engaging in online tutorial tasks and online discussions. Critical thinking skills of the students could be evaluated based on student learning outcomes, e.g. student discussions and answering questions while undertaking online tutorial tasks.},

  abstract = {Although international students make up a significant percentage of the college population and contribute to higher education institutions in multiple ways, a lack of attention is paid to their safety needs. This dissertation examined the experiences and perceptions of campus safety among international college/university students in the United States. The researcher sampled participants from different institutions around the country, who self-identified as international students. A researcher-developed 53-item Likert scale questionnaire, International Students' Safety Questionnaire (ISSQ), was administered to the sample. Findings from the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) provided evidence for the four-factor solution for the 26-item ISSQ accounting for 48.65\% of the shared variance. Additionally, the ISSQ was found to have adequate internal consistency, a Cronbach alpha of .85 for the overall instrument and subscale alphas ranging from .72 to .81. Salient demographic variables, such as nationality, faith belief, college status and perceived proficiency in English, were found to be significantly linked to derived factor scores. Further, significant positive correlations were found between personality variables, such as extraversion, openness, and neuroticism, and the derived factor scores. Implications for counseling, counselor education, and higher education institutions, along with limitations and directions for future research are included.},

More specifically, it argues that a decolonizing holistic pedagogy can help address the root of our individual and collective alienation to facilitate healing. This position is supported by the findings of an ethnographic study, conducted in 2013-2014, highlighting Poetry for the People (P4P), an arts/activism course started by poet-activist-professor, June Jordan, at UC Berkeley. The article opens with a theoretical framework that centers healing and love as decolonial priorities and pedagogical imperatives, and speaks to the mindbodyspirit labor, restoration, and creativity involved in decolonizing education. Emphasizing the need for decolonizing epistemologies to inform classroom dialogue, this article points to the power inherent in those dialogues for creating connections that mend alienation and for generating apertures for personal and social transformation. However, it is the voices of the P4P participants interviewed that give testimony to the effectiveness of a decolonizing holistic pedagogy to foster rigorous investigation of self and society, authentic community-building across difference, as well as the healing power of writing, sharing, and witnessing others share personal/political poetry.},

In this study, erubrics are applied in a Preschool (3-6 year-olds) and Primary Education (6-12 year-olds) pre-service teacher context. 87 students from two Spanish universities enrolled in a quarterly course of Education Technologies in the Faculty of Education used erubrics ({\copyright}Gtea) for self- and peer assessment. Through a satisfaction survey, the study concluded that electronic rubric is an assessment facilitating resource for students as participants in the assessment process. Students tend to be satisfied with their use in both self- and peer assessment and acknowledge certain advantages regarding rubric features, implementation process and impact on learning process.},

This study used two open-ended questionnaires to explore university students' critical incidents of fairness and unfairness and their affective and behavioral reactions to experiences of un/fairness. The findings showed that students' perceptions of CA fairness were comprised of distributive, procedural, and interactional justice principles. Collectively, students considered the distribution of outcomes, the procedures for outcome distributions, the interpersonal relationships, and the communication procedures in conceptualizing fairness. Students also reported positive feelings such as happiness, satisfaction, feeling valued, and hopefulness when describing fair incidents, while they tended to report negative feelings such as anger, upset, disappointment, and embarrassment as responses to unfair incidents. Students also reported increased classroom engagement and greater adaptation in responses to fairness incidents, while they reported class disengagement, inaction, and dissent as responses to unfair incidents. Building on these empirical findings, a more comprehensive conceptualization of fairness in CA contexts is proposed.},

  abstract = {The realities of the 21st century have led professors and lecturers to renew their learning assessment practices so that they are more adapted to and contextualized in the current professional world. Despite advances in teaching and learning, assessment methods may still deviate from practice in authentic contexts. Although some instructors are already familiar with more authentic assessments, most are accustomed to using exams as standard practices to test students' achievement of course objectives and essays to prepare students for research or written argumentation. Despite their benefits, such typical assessments often lack authenticity and do not develop the full potential of students' 21st-century learning or literacy skills such as communication, creativity, or working with technologies. Over the past decade, we have been witnessing the beginnings of a broader reflection on teaching, learning, and evaluating with technologies, including more authentic assessments. This reflective essay will present how technologies make it possible to diversify assessment methods, resulting in enhanced authenticity and development of 21st-century learning and literacy skills. Authentic assessment methods with technologies will be illustrated, e.g., recorded video presentations, explanatory interviews with descriptive assessment grids, PechaKucha presentations, blog posts, and social media and e-portfolios, with examples from several disciplines. Authors will also explain how proposing a number of methods to students for the same assessment may help answer their various needs and preferences without increasing instructors' grading load. Furthermore, authors will discuss how diversifying assessment methods with technologies often results in a transformation of assessment modalities. Beyond assessments as an evaluation of knowledge and/or skills at a fixed schedule, authentic assessments with technologies may become continuous or iterative processes with multiple feedbacks from instructors, thereby combining synchronous interactions and/or discussions with asynchronous reflections to improve students' involvement and active learning.},

This paper firstly presents a short review of the literature regarding online engagement in the higher education environment, moving beyond discipline-specific engagement. It then presents a conceptual framework which builds upon recurring themes within the literature, including students' beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. The framework was developed by adopting a constant comparison method to analyse the literature, and to search for and identify current and emerging themes. The framework identifies indicators for five key elements of online engagement, and the authors propose that the framework provides a guide for researchers and academics when exploring online engagement from a conceptual, practical and research basis. Finally, the paper provides recommendations for practice, outlining how the framework might be used to reflect critically upon the effectiveness of online courses and their ability to engage students.},

The research took place at three Australian universities in July and August 2020 during the emergency transition to online learning and assessment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The study sought to inform decision making about the future of online exams at the participating universities. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected using online surveys. The findings of the study led to seven key observations, most notably the need to redefine the characteristics of academic misconduct to account for changes wrought to examinations in a digital world. The study concludes with lessons learned in relation to enhancing academic integrity in digital examinations and assessments.},

Assessment in higher education has traditionally focused on retention of knowledge and its application in limited contexts as measured by paper and pencil tests and academic assignments such as writing term papers. Increased interest among academics in what has been labeled ?alternative assessment? reflects both dissatisfaction with national approaches to assessment and the desire to assess the attainment of higher order educational goals that involve deep understanding and active use of knowledge in complex, realistic contexts. Concerns about current assessment approaches are increasing as online learning environments become more prevalent in higher education. The article prescribes three different approaches to integrating alternative assessment approaches into online learning environments: 1) cognitive assessment, 2) performance assessment, and 3) portfolio assessment.},

Assessment is an essential part of teaching and learning, as it establishes the achievement of course learning outcomes by the students. Computer-based assessment is in place for a long time now, however, online assessments have been less practiced. This is because of the issues of validity, reliability and dishonesty. During the COVID 19 pandemic, the educational environment has taken a paradigm shift in many medical schools, both nationally and internationally. This situation demands a method of assessment that is safe, valid, reliable, acceptable, feasible and fair. This paper describes the different formats of online assessment and their application in formative and summative assessments during and after the COVID 19 pandemic.},

The result shows how a framework from another research field can be adjusted to analyze data about the assessment situations. Next, by utilizing the different components (themes) of the adjusted framework, we shed light on perspectives on misconducts in un-proctored home exams. In doing so, the paper informs the discussion on challenges related to assessing students in mathematics at home. Results are relevant for future educational settings since change in the demographic profile of students increase topicality of online assessment.},

Numerous studies indicate that well-designed digital games integrated in learning settings can perform both entertainment and educational purposes. Many educators have adopted digital games for building active and engaging learning environments to enhance students' learning outcomes. However, game-based assessment (GBA) is underdeveloped in the field of knowledge assessment. Among different types of game-based assessments, stealth assessment can be effectively used to reduce students' test anxiety and to overcome the limitations of traditional standardized and high-stake tests. However, limited research has focused on how to effectively design and implement stealth assessment to evaluate the soft skills which are valued in the twenty-first century, such as problem-solving, creativity, and teamwork. Through investigating previous studies, the chapter will examine the theoretical and pragmatic bases of stealth assessment design and the effective practices of stealth assessment implementation and interpretation. The critical analysis addressed in the chapter will contribute to the knowledge in the field of stealth assessment on soft skills measurement. Finally, recommendations and implications will be discussed to improve the development of GBA.},

However, many studies focus on just one aspect of technology's role in educational assessment practices, leaving a gap in studies that examine how various aspects affect the use of technology in assessments. Hence, through a systematic work, we analyzed the extent and manner in which technology is integrated into educational assessments and how education level, domain of learning, and region may affect the use of technology. We reviewed empirical studies from two major databases (i.e., Scopus and ERIC) and a national journal whose focus and scope are on educational measurement and assessment, following PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews. The findings of the present study are directed towards emphasizing the roles of technology in educational assessment practices and how these roles are adapted to varying educational contexts such as the level of education, the three domains of learning (i.e., cognitive, psychomotor, and affective), and the setting in which the assessment was conducted. These findings not only highlight the current roles of technology in educational assessment but also provide a roadmap for future research aimed at optimizing the integration of technology across diverse educational contexts.},

The study used a set of novel theoretical frameworks to identify training needs in digital media production, development of assessment weightings, marking rubrics and student training and resources. Longitudinal data were captured over a period of 4 years (n = 1724) using a mixed-methods approach. Validated questionnaires measured student attitudes to digital media support and attitudes to technology, understanding of the assignment, knowledge construction and digital media for learning and career development. Open-ended questions helped gather suggestions from students for improving the assessment task. Questionnaire data were analysed by using descriptive statistics and qualitative data with thematic analysis. The results suggested that students enjoyed group work, found learning with digital media to be engaging and developed critical thinking and digital media skills. In conclusion, STEM students had a positive learning experience repurposing mobile technology as pedagogical devices that present knowledge by using a multi-modal approach mediated by digital media.},

LGDM across disciplines is under-theorised, under-researched, and only in its early development. This paper evaluates the research in the field of LGDM in tertiary science education. The literature review had four stages -- identification, screening, filtering, and selection of relevant scholarly research. Results showed that research in the field of LGDM assignments had been done without a systematic approach to designing, implementing, and evaluating the assessment task. Most studies neglected student digital media training and are characterised by a lack of compelling marking rubrics or strategies to ensure efficient groupwork. Studies also lack rigorous methodologies for data capture to evaluate the intervention and they use small sample size cohorts and different digital media types that require different sets of production skills. With the empirical data available, validation of the benefits of LGDM assignments in science education is not possible, and studies have limited scalability. These gaps in the literature create a need to develop theoretical models for the design, implementation, and evaluation of LGDM in the classroom. This paper discusses future research needs in this field and the implications for assessment design.},

  abstract = {This study sought to explore Indonesian university students' perceptions, problems, and suggestions of the application of blended learning in their EFL [English as a Foreign Language] courses. A questionnaire consisting of 6 categories (benefits of online learning, benefits of face-to-face learning, learning assessment, problems in blended learning, suggestions for quality improvement of blended learning, and open-ended questions) was used as the research instrument. The collected data were analyzed descriptively and qualitatively. The results showed that most of the students perceived positively both the online and face-to-face modes used in their blended EFL courses, although they tended to have negative views on certain online technical aspects. Internet connectivity was the main problem and the solution of all technical problems was the main suggestion reported by the students. As this research was conducted only with students from one study program, the results should not be generalized and future research is suggested to be more focused on the comparison of students' preferences for other blended course formats and relate them to students' EFL achievement.},

A systematic search of PsycINFO and Web of Knowledge databases between 1997 and 2010 identified 7,167 English-language articles yielding 241 data sets, which reported on 50 conceptually distinct correlates of GPA, including 3 demographic factors and 5 traditional measures of cognitive capacity or prior academic performance. In addition, 42 non-intellective constructs were identified from 5 conceptually overlapping but distinct research domains: (a) personality traits, (b) motivational factors, (c) self-regulatory learning strategies, (d) students' approaches to learning, and (e) psychosocial contextual influences. We retrieved 1,105 independent correlations and analyzed data using hypothesis-driven, random-effects meta-analyses. Significant average, weighted correlations were found for 41 of 50 measures. Univariate analyses revealed that demographic and psychosocial contextual factors generated, at best, small correlations with GPA. Medium-sized correlations were observed for high school GPA, SAT, ACT, and A level scores. Three non-intellective constructs also showed medium-sized correlations with GPA: academic self-efficacy, grade goal, and effort regulation. A large correlation was observed for performance self-efficacy, which was the strongest correlate (of 50 measures) followed by high school GPA, ACT, and grade goal. Implications for future research, student assessment, and intervention design are discussed. (Contains 11 tables and 1 figure.)},

Participation in education is a key factor affecting the life chances for Indigenous children of the Pacific, yet they have lower rates of participation than non-Indigenous people. Pacific twenty-first-century learning requires new culturally inclusive spaces that do not override Indigenous cultures but draw upon them as a learning foundation on which to build new digital learning. Research on technology and equity as a means of raising school achievement are becoming more attractive in education systems seeking to improve school processes and outcomes. Although international research in this area is extensive, covering about two decades, there are still gaps in its research base specifically on the concept of Culturally Responsive Digital Education for Indigenous peoples. While literature on culturally responsive schooling (CRS) for academic improvement of American Indian and Alaska Natives peoples has emerged, this literature is yet to theorize Indigenous online education and complimentary teacher pedagogy, especially in the Pacific. This chapter will define culturally responsive digital schooling (CRDS) for Indigenous peoples of the Pacific drawing from robust information communication technology (ICT) research, critical and CRS studies. This chapter first argues the need for CRDS that comprises of three interdependent dimensions of ``benefits,'' ``decolonization,'' and ``cultural responsiveness.'' Understanding these dimensions are necessary before purpose, effects, or impact of CRDS can be understood. Finally, the chapter defines CRDS and proposes a ten-point model as a cultural standard to support CRDS Indigenous schooling in the Pacific.},

  abstract = {Assessment is and has been a deliberate and essential piece of education. However, with the recent emergence and popularity of online education, faculty members have to find new ways to engage online learners with formative assessments. While much of the online learning environment can be self-guided, faculty interventions can make the content more engaging for the learner. Biggs and Tang (2011) note the term "backwash" which refers to the direct effect assessments have on a student's learning. Baleni (2015) further expounded on this point by stating that the assessments, not the curriculum, can define how and what a student learns. Using technology to create engaging formative assessment is one way that faculty members can enhance student learning while helping learners prepare for a summative assessment. However, one of the important findings of this study is the time and effort saved by online faculty members using this type of technology for formative assessment. Using an independent samples t-test, this study found a nonsignificant difference in quiz scores between the two formats (paper or Socrative) for formative assessment. The results suggest that Web 2.0 tools can be just beneficial in helping students prepare for a summative assessment. In addition, when chosen wisely, these tools can also influence participation, student wait time for feedback, and teacher grading time.},

This article has had high impact, not only in terms of citations, but it also launched a multimillion-dollar university project and numerous synchronous massive online courses (SMOCs). In this study, I present a closer look at the data used in the Pennebaker et al. study. As in many cases of false claims, threats to internal validity were not adequately addressed. Student performance increases in other courses can be explained entirely by selection bias, whereas achievement gap reductions may be explained by differential attrition. It is hoped that the findings reported in this paper will inform future decisions regarding SMOC courses. More importantly, our field needs watchdogs who expose such unsupported extravagant claims---especially those appearing in pay-to-publish journals.},

The purpose of this quantitative study is to analyze whether the adoption of open science textbooks significantly affects science learning outcomes for secondary students in earth systems, chemistry, and physics.This study uses a quantitative quasi-experimental design with propensity score matched groups and multiple regression to examine whether student learning was influenced by the adoption of open textbooks instead of traditional publisher-produced textbooks. Students who used open textbooks scored .65 points higher on end-of-year state standardized science tests than students using traditional textbooks when controlling for the effects of 10 student and teacher covariates. Further analysis revealed statistically significant positive gains for students using the open chemistry textbooks, with no significant difference in student scores for earth systems of physics courses. Although the effect size of the gains were relatively small, and not consistent across all textbooks, the finding that open textbooks can be as effective or even slightly more effective than their traditional counterparts has important considerations in terms of school district policy in a climate of finite educational funding.}

On the other hand, we have been witnessing the increased relationship between technology and education, which created an opportunity for education to evolve and enhance the use of digital tools in classes. During several lockdowns worldwide, due to the pandemic crisis, millions of students and teachers were forced to continue the process of teaching and learning at home and experienced Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT), which led to new challenges on the process of students' assessment. To understand what assessment challenges teachers face during the ERT and their patterns for evaluation, we performed a survey in Portugal where the ERT lasted several months in the last two years. The survey was validated and conducted in the first semester of 2021. We found two main patterns: (i) the group of teachers that prefer oral discussion and dialogue simulation and display disbelief towards traditional tests and educational games; and (ii) the group of teachers that tend to prefer oral simulation and display greater disbelief about educational games, dialogue simulation and peer work and review. From the survey analysis, we also found that teachers considered their students to be more distracted and less engaged in online classes. They were negatively affected both in their learning and evaluation process. Using digital tools to collect and validate data and creating patterns between collected data is essential to understand what to expect in future crises. The presented analysis should be correlated with other studies to extract patterns of knowledge from data and to be able to obtain conclusions about how to move education forward.},

There is conflicting evidence, however, on whether the engagement benefits of such applications outweigh their potential cost as a source of disaffection. To investigate these issues, this article presents a case study on the usage of a social media app (SpeakUp) during a semester-long face-to-face university course, and its relations with the context and the learning outcomes. In this mixed-methods study, we gathered data from multiple sources (video recordings of the lessons, SpeakUp logs and messages, student questionnaires, and course assessments) in order to extract self-reported and observable behavioral and emotional indicators. Our findings reveal that simple measures of behavioral engagement were insufficient to predict academic performance. Nevertheless, our models significantly improved using relatively simple and unobtrusive indicators of both behavioral and emotional engagement and disaffection. This article also indicates that the mere introduction of social media in educational settings does not guarantee a positive impact on learning. To promote an effective use of social media in the classroom (raising engagement while avoiding disaffection), teachers need to design the learning activities aligning the use of social media with the learning goals.},

The study suggests that to be successfully integrated in a programme, such activities need to be carefully aligned with learning outcomes and assessment practices, and their value needs to be clear both to students and staff. The paper describes how e-tivities were designed, adopting a constructive alignment approach, to introduce more flexible and innovative approaches to learning and assessment. The e-tivities used a range of technologies (e.g., voice-based discussion boards, podcasts, wikis and blogs) to carry out group-based reflective activities. The study provides some evidence that such e-tivities, particularly voice-based activities, can help provide earlier, more detailed formative assessment, stimulate a more collaborative approach to learning and motivate students to engage more broadly with course content.},

One claim of MOOCs in the tradition of Open Educational Resources is to expand access to education, mainly in the field of higher education. But do MOOCs meet this claim? The empirical data in this article confirm the suspicion that, despite all the heterogeneity of the participants, MOOCs are mostly used by people with a higher level of education. Data of participants from two MOOCs from Germany, as well as, empirical data from large providers and universities are used. But due to the different forms of MOOCs there is no comprehensive proof possible. With respect to the Knowledge Gap Theory and the Digital Divide, a theoretical framework is provided to explain possible causes of a different usage. The aim of the article is to point out the risks of an increase of inequalities as a consequence of hyping MOOCs and to stimulate a discussion about possible answers to make MOOCs an instrument of education for all.},

Assessment is considered an integral part of the learning process, but it has always been considered challenging for teachers. Through the adoption of information technologies, it is possible to create new opportunities to improve assessment. Despite its numerous advantages, e-assessment remains a topic of much discussion for many, due to doubts that arise about its efficiency and effectiveness. In order to understand this issue, this study aims to explore e-assessment in higher education, from the viewpoint of teachers and students. Four online surveys were distributed among teachers and students in Portugal and other countries. While the results show that Portugal is slightly behind in terms of adoption, there is a strong awareness of the importance of e-assessment. Internationally, e-assessment has higher adoption rates, and both teachers and students believe that this method of assessment is advantageous.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This study centers on high school pre-teacher education students' reviews of their peers' digital stories. The purpose of this study is twofold: to bring digital storytelling to the forefront as a literacy practice within classrooms that seeks to privilege students' voices and experiences and also to encapsulate the authors' different experiences and perspectives as teachers. The authors sought to understand how pre-teacher education candidates analyzed, understood and made meaning from their classmates' digital stories using the seven elements of digital storytelling (Dreon "et al.," 2011). Design/methodology/approach: Using grounded theory (Charmaz, 2008) as a framework, the question of how do high school pre-teacher education program candidates reflectively peer review their classmates' digital stories is addressed and discussed through university and high school instructors' narrative reflections. Through peer reviews of their fellow classmates' digital stories, students were able to use the digital storytelling guide that included the seven elements of digital storytelling planning to critique and offer suggestions. The authors used the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 cohorts' digital stories, digital storytelling guides and peer reviews to discover emerging categories and themes and then made sense of these through narrative analysis. This study looks at students' narratives through the contexts of peer reviews. Findings: The seven elements of digital storytelling, as noted by Dreon "et al." (2011, p. 5), which are point of view, dramatic question, emotional content, the gift of your voice, the power of the soundtrack, economy and pacing, were used as starting points for coding students' responses in their evaluations of their peers' digital stories. Situated on the premise of 21st century technologies as important promoters of differentiated ways of teaching and learning that are highly interactive (Greenhow "et al.," 2009), digital stories and students' reflective practices of peer reviewing were the foundational aspects of this paper. Research limitations/implications: The research the authors have done has been in regards to reviewing and analyzing students' peer reviews of their classmates' digital stories, so the authors did not conduct a research study empirical in nature. What the authors have done is to use students' artifacts (digital story, digital storytelling guides and reflections/peer reviews) to allow students' authentic voices and perspectives to emerge without their own perspectives marring these. The authors, as teachers, are simply the tools of analysis. Practical implications: In reading this paper, teachers of different grade levels will be able to obtain ideas on using digital storytelling in their classrooms first. Second, teachers will be able to obtain hands-on tools for implementing digital storytelling. For example, the digital storytelling guide to which the authors refer (Figure 1) can be used in different subject areas to help students plan their stories. Teachers will also be able to glean knowledge on using students' peer reviews as a kind of authentic assessment. Social implications: The authors hope in writing and presenting this paper is that teachers and instructors at different levels, K-12 through higher education, will consider digital storytelling as a pedagogical and learning practice to spark deeper conversations within the classroom that flow beyond margins and borders of instructional settings out into the community and beyond. The authors hope that others will use opportunities for storytelling, digital, verbal, traditional writing and other ways to spark conversations and privilege students' voices and lives. Originality/value: As the authors speak of the original notion of using students' crucial events as story starters, this is different than prior research for digital storytelling that has focused on lesson units or subject area content. Also, because the authors have used crucial events, this is an entry point to students' lives and the creation of rapport within the classroom.},

An ad hoc questionnaire was applied to a total sample of 1,243 students, 487 graduates and 345 lecturers from 24 Spanish universities that cover most of Spain's Regional Autonomous Communities. The results from the questionnaires indicate that for all three groups the most relevant element in the assessment process is the teacher-student interaction, and the second most relevant are the competences in interpersonal relationships. Significant differences are also found in practically all the items in the questionnaire between the responses of lecturers and students and between those of students and graduates. In our detailed study of the perceptions of students regarding their competence in ICT, those taking the degree in PTPE perceive a greater use of ICT than those taking the degree in PESS. The same difference was found with students under 22 years of age in relation to the older students. No gender differences were found.},

The primary results show a relationship between pedagogical beliefs and evaluation which is consistent with adoption and assessment of the digital tool used. In addition, it reveals the role of beliefs as secondary barriers to change in the face of teaching practices with the use of technology (Ertmer, Ottenbreit-Leftwich, Sadik, Sendurur, \& Sendurur, 2012). This study identifies the value of autonomy in student work and feedback as key beliefs in technology adoption.},

One solution to these assessment demands is to use computer-based (virtual) agents to serve as the collaborators in the interactions with students. This article proposes a human-to-agent (H-A) approach for formative CPS assessment and describes an international pilot study aimed to provide preliminary empirical findings on the use of H-A CPS assessment to inform collaborative learning. Overall, the findings showed promise in terms of using a H-A CPS assessment task as a formative tool for structuring effective groups in the context of CPS online learning.

Students indicated that they were pleasantly surprised at the effectiveness of the online assignment. However, analytics showed that students progressed through most of the steps fairly quickly; thus, instructors plan to improve future deployments by using a variety of interactive assessments and adding more layered criteria and clues within each of the escape room steps.},

This potential and the ubiquity of computer conferencing in higher education prompted three of the authors of the this article to develop a community of inquiry model that synthesizes pedagogical principles with the inherent instructional and access benefits of computer conferencing (Garrison, Anderson, \& Archer, 2000). This article explicates one element of the model, social presence. Social presence is defined as the ability of learners to project themselves socially and affectively into a community of inquiry. A template for assessing social presence in computer conferencing is presented through content analysis of conferencing transcripts. To facilitate explication of the scheme and subsequent replication of this study, selections of coded transcripts are included, along with interrater reliability figures. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications and benefits of assessing social presence for instructors, conference moderators, and researchers.}

Of the 252 reports, 48 collected and analyzed data on one or more aspects of the CoI framework; only five included a measure of student learning. Predominantly, learning was defined as perceived learning and assessed with a single item on a closed-form survey. Concerns about the soundness of such measures pervade the educational measurement community; in addition, we question the validity of the particular items employed in the CoI literature. Bracketing these concerns, the review indicates that it is unlikely that deep and meaningful learning arises in CoI. Students associate the surface learning that does occur with independent activities or didactic instruction; not sustained communication in critical CoI. We encourage researchers to conduct more, substantial investigations into the central construct of the popular framework for e-learning and theorists to respond to the mounting body of disconfirming evidence.},

  abstract = {A partially-automated method of assessment is proposed, in which automated question setting is used to generate individualized versions of a coursework assignment, which is completed by students and marked by hand. This is designed to be (a) comparable to a traditional written coursework assignment in validity, in that complex and open-ended tasks can be set with diverse submission formats that would not be suitable for written examination or automated marking; and, (b) comparable to e-assessment in terms of reduction of academic misconduct, with individualization acting as a barrier to copying and collusion. This method of assessment is implemented in practice. Evaluation focuses on expert second-marking, student feedback and analysis of marks, and aims to establish that the partially-automated method can be useful in practice. The partially-automated method proposed appears to be capable of adapting a coursework assignment to make it less sensitive to copying and collusion (and therefore more reliable) while maintaining its validity, though leading to reduced efficiency for the marker. This paper therefore contributes the introduction of a novel approach to assessment which offers a way to bring automated individualization to the assessment of higher order skills in higher education mathematics.},

  abstract = {As ePortfolios are increasingly being used in universities to help develop self-reflective practitioners, academic teachers and students need to develop the skills and processes required to implement them. During 2015, a series of webinars was presented by a cross-university team to provide professional development for academic teachers, curriculum designers and other staff interested in initiating or extending ePortfolio learning in their institutions. A survey was conducted with participants to gauge the depth of understanding and use of ePortfolios in degree programs. The survey aimed to clarify participants' perception of the value of ePortfolio tools in Australian universities, and to identify future directions for developing knowledge and learning related to ePortfolios. Through the survey questions participants were able to provide information anonymously about their knowledge and use of ePortfolios. Respondents were also invited to be interviewed. Nine interviews, conducted in 2016, explored ePortfolio-users' opinions of the learning tool. The results indicate that teachers' use of the ePortfolio as a learning tool has evolved beyond that reported in the current literature. Furthermore, when used for reflection, assessment and documenting professional standards, the ePortfolio tool contributes to the students' development of skills required to transition to future careers.},

The phrase ``That's just your opinion!'' (as wielded by contestants on the television series ``American Idol'') is used to shield not only preferences but also judgments from public scrutiny. This misunderstanding springs from confusion between pluralism and relativism. Students' fear of moral absolutism leads them to espouse relativism when they should be promoting pluralism. Within a conception of education as a social practice that mediates between the private and the public, students must learn both to justify their own judgments and to examine the judgments and justifications that others provide. This requires that students learn to distinguish ``just my opinion'' and ``just your opinion'' from morally significant judgments.}

Firstly, and technologically, the period opened with the establishment of one of the most successful of the multi-media based distance education systems, the UK Open University, but ends with the rush towards online education. This technological change underpins a second change, a pedagogical shift within distance education from a transmission model of education towards a constructivist model exploiting computer-mediated communication. Paradoxically this has occurred just when some commentators have seen the dehumanization of the traditional education. The third change has been the growing acceptance of distance education, and with this, its expansion. Linked to this is the fourth change ? the change in the way distance education is perceived. It has moved from low status to acceptance, with increased confidence as its methods are adopted across education as a whole. Finally, distance education can be seen to be evolving from an essentially modernist (bureaucratic or Fordist) form of education into a post-modernist phenomenon with a focus on the student as consumer, on flexibility and global reach.},

We observed four major themes: personal factors, contextual factors of the structure and culture, teacher thinking, and teachers' practice. These themes revealed that the professors in this study adapted quickly using institutionally offered platforms, modified their courses as minimally as possible, struggled with assessment, and held diverging beliefs about teaching and students. The outcomes of this study have implications for ongoing efforts to reform instructional practices at the institutional and departmental level. Specifically, we recommend similar studies to ascertain current faculty beliefs and instructional practices in other departments in order to identify shared visions for change and effective supports for enacting that change.},

Deep learning indicates understanding and creative use of knowledge in new settings, i.e. the highest levels in the revised version of Bloom's taxonomy, a knowledge dimension from factual knowledge to meta-knowledge. Data are based on two evaluation processes: a university student who conducted a process of making digital stories in a class of upper secondary school students, and secondly, by 41 university students who did a two-step evaluation process of these stories. Despite the Norwegian learning context, from which data are obtained, the approaches will largely be recognizable in other countries because of the general learning principles and framework for teaching geographical topics. The study shows that digital storytelling has the potential to improve interactive learning outcome that can enhance ethical and deep learning of geography, including "the affective domain" of how geography is felt and valued. The awareness of integration of technology into the learning process is underlined.},

Research has highlighted the benefits of ATMC in improving various elements of spoken communication, but to date, its application to EAP contexts has been little studied. In EAP speaking/listening courses at a large Canadian university, a team of instructor-researchers developed a system to provide learners more speaking and listening practice opportunities and to give individualized video feedback (veedback) on speaking performance. The instructor-researchers used a practitioner enquiry research methodology to investigate the effectiveness of the voice-based ATMC for 14 participants, drawing upon qualitative data from student interviews and the instructor's qualitative and quantitative assessment of the students' responses to tasks. Findings indicate that the system resulted in overall gains in fluency, accuracy, and intelligibility due to a combination of the voice-based ATMC design, repetition and practice, and the veedback. Qualitative comments from participants indicate personalized feedback led to increased motivation. The framework described in this article, therefore, represents several important benefits for the application of voice-based ATMCs in EAP classrooms.},

Specifically, the study attempts to find out whether universities are prepared for online assessment during the lockdown and to probe feasible solutions to the challenges that hinder proper assessment in a virtual learning environment (VLE). As the challenges are determined, the study suggests a number of practical solutions. Data on faculty's observations were obtained by means of an online survey. Eighty-three faculty members participated in this study. The findings showed that universities swiftly shifted to e-classes during the lockdown but that they were not adequately primed for an appropriate assessment in an online environment. The findings further showed that instructors were skeptical about the efficiency of remote assessment of their students. In addition, faculty members believed there was still a long way to go with regards to (1) the unavailability of reliable software to preclude academic dishonesty; (2) some faculty being unable to assess their students in VLE as it was their first experience; and (3) formative assessment not having been given enough attention. It is concluded that universities should have an exigency strategy for any sudden future lockdowns. This strategy includes, among other things, intensive e-teaching and e-testing training for faculty, high-tech invigilation and plagiarism software, reliable e-learning platforms with sufficient Internet bandwidth, setting up an e-assessment council at the university level.},

This interpretivist and conceptual systematic review sought to consider the different forms of educational practices that are framed in relation to feedforward. The initial search of four electronic databases found 1076 articles published between 2007 and 2019, which were reduced to 68 once duplicates had been removed and exclusion/inclusion criteria applied during screening and eligibility procedures. An iterative meta-ethnographic approach to analysis resulted in the identification of five main practices, framed as feedforward. These were: alignment and timing (41\%); use (25\%); comments (18\%); self-review (9\%); and teaching (7\%). The vast majority involved a process where student improvement was a key goal, but the design of this process differed between practices. A large proportion supported improvement from one task to the next, almost exclusively within the ?future horizon? of the module/study unit, while only a small proportion of articles focuses on improving the amount, nature or quality of the information delivered to learners. Evidence of student sense-making and uptake was rarely sought, and few practices offered genuine opportunities for student agency, self-regulation and the development of evaluative judgment.}

Eight teachers from two universities constructed an initial concept map about assessment that was discussed in a one-to-one semi-structured interview. A year later, a new map was created and the interview focused on change in thinking and practice. Multiple models of assessment were evident in the participants' understandings at the same time and change was characterised by subtle evolution in thinking. Development in practice was more significant and often associated with the foregrounding of assessment for learning. Vignettes are used to illustrate the variation in nature and scale of development. Interplay between this development of practice and understanding was multidirectional and external context played an important role. The approach offers detailed insight into the relationship between assessment thinking and practice and demonstrates that both research and academic development need to go beyond conventional approaches to conceptualising the development of academics and take account of the finer grained complexities of assessment thinking and practices.},

On the basis of the data from a student survey made during the COVID-19 pandemic, who studied using distance digital technologies, we have analyzed the current state of higher education. Consequently, the authors have concluded that the universities, implementing programs for the digitalization of the educational process and the creation of massive online courses, are actually away from the real social circles of the post-digital society. Given the results, the authors argue that digitalization is not a way to resolve the internal contradictions of higher education. Moreover, digitalization as a goal of higher education somewhat hides the real contradictions of the learning process.},

  abstract = {Assessments are conducted to determine the effectiveness of learning. One type of these assessments are formative assessment, which aims to fill the gap between the learner's present situation and the desired situation by giving feedback to learners. For this purpose, Classroom Response Systems can be used in large groups. Paper-based tests, Kahoot, Quizizz, and, Plickers were used for formative assessment. Multiple-choice tests can be created for students with these applications. Students can connect to Kahoot and Quizizz applications via any computer, tablet or mobile phones with an internet connection and answer the questions in the test. For the Plickers application, the questions are displayed by the instructor in an area that all students can see. Students indicate their responses by lifting their paper which has QR code. The instructor scans these QR codes with the help of a mobile device and the students' answers are seen directly. In this context, the perceived usefulness and behavioral intention of the students to use different classroom response systems were investigated. The research was conducted with freshman students at a state university and continued for four weeks. Different applications were presented to the students as like that a paper-based test, Kahoot, Quizizz, and Plickers. When the findings were examined, it was found that students noted Kahoot, Quizizz, and Plickers applications were statistically more useful than the paper-based test. Based on these results, it can be said that students prefer to use technology-supported classroom response systems instead of the paper-based test.},

Recent pandemic and its after effects are still looming over the globe, posing as challenge and an opportunity for educators. Online education was one such innovation, which has changed the dynamics of education around the world. The purpose of the paper is three-fold, first, to assess the levels of student engagement in the online learning environment, second, to examine how student engagement is related to their academic performance using learning analytic tools and third, to propose an integrated learning analytics framework. The study used, an exploratory research method and the data was collected from multiple sources; LMS Logs, self-administered questionnaires from students, and interviews with the instructor. The study was conducted at a course level in a private university. The finding suggests a positive relationship between student engagement and their academic performance and advocate the application of an analytics plug-in on LMS which supported instructors in identifying students at risk and providing them with real-time feedback aiming to improve their performance. The study provides insights into the field of online learning and offers evidence-based recommendations to educators. The utilization of Learning Analytics to examine student engagement and understanding of how students learn would contribute to the development of learning theories and in designing an appropriate digital learning environment that supports and improves their learning.},

Recently, there has been a research focus on the application of AI in education, where it has great potential. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature on AI in education is therefore necessary. This article considers its usage and applications in Latin American higher education institutions. After identifying the studies dedicated to educational innovations brought about by the application of AI techniques, this review examines AI applications in three educational processes: learning, teaching, and administration. Each study is analyzed for the AI techniques used, such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, the AI tools and algorithms that are applied, and the main education topic. The results reveal that the main AI applications in education are: predictive modelling, intelligent analytics, assistive technology, automatic content analysis, and image analytics. It is further demonstrated that AI applications help to address important education issues (e.g., detecting students at risk of dropping out) and thereby contribute to ensuring quality education. Finally, the article presents the lessons learned from the review concerning the application of AI technologies in higher education in the Latin American context.},

Because the future of our nation depends on how well our educational institutions develop, nurture, and deploy talent, this study identified factors that promoted online course completion among African American male undergraduate students. The researchers interviewed 10 males who successfully completed online courses and identified significant themes. Factors that contributed to online course completion were financial assistance, prior academic achievement, previous information technology (IT) training, continuous academic enrollment, student selection of topics perceived as uncomplicated and less demanding or familiar due to sufficient prior knowledge, use of handheld digital devices, and a non-prejudicial learning environment. This study also revealed challenges and obstacles encountered by participants. Based on these findings, the researchers made recommendations that include strategies policymakers and educationalists can implement to promote academic achievement and degree attainment among African American males in higher education.},

  abstract = {This article focuses on teachers' experiences in implementing peer assessment with first semester students. It explores the relationship between teachers' conceptions of teaching and their approach to peer assessment, where both conceptions and approaches are described as being either learning focused or content focused. Drawing upon analysis of interviews with eight teachers, the study found that one had a consonant view of the interrelationship between conceptions of teaching and approaches to peer assessment, while the remaining seven described their conceptions of teaching and their approaches to peer assessment with a combination of learning-focused and contentfocused statements. These statements are labelled as dissonant. Discussion focuses on implications of consonant and dissonant relationships between conceptions of teaching and approaches to peer assessment for implementation of peer assessment; it also addresses academic development issues. The study reveals that when implementing new methods (here, peer assessment), underlying assumptions will impact on the nature of teacher engagement. Cet article porte sur les exp{\'e}riences d'enseignants qui mettent en oeuvre l'{\'e}valuation par les pairs avec des {\'e}tudiants du premier semestre. On y explore la relation entre les conceptions des enseignants sur l'enseignement et leur approche envers l'{\'e}valuation par les pairs, ces deux conception et approche {\'e}tant ax{\'e}es soit sur l'apprentissage, soit sur le contenu. En s'appuyant sur l'analyse d'entretiens avec huit enseignants, l'{\'e}tude a r{\'e}v{\'e}l{\'e} que seul un d'entre eux {\'e}tait favorable {\`a} la relation entre les conceptions de l'enseignement et les m{\'e}thodes d'{\'e}valuation par les pairs, tandis que les sept autres ont d{\'e}crit leurs conceptions de l'enseignement et leurs m{\'e}thodes d'{\'e}valuation par les pairs avec des d{\'e}clarations ax{\'e}es sur l'apprentissage et le contenu. Ces d{\'e}clarations sont {\'e}tiquet{\'e}es comme discordantes. La discussion porte sur les implications des relations concordantes et discordantes entre les conceptions de l'enseignement et les m{\'e}thodes d'{\'e}valuation par les pairs, pour la mise en oeuvre de l'{\'e}valuation par ceux-ci; elle aborde {\'e}galement les questions de perfectionnement scolaire. D'apr{\`e}s l'{\'e}tude, lorsqu'on applique de nouvelles m{\'e}thodes, les hypoth{\`e}ses sous-jacentes ont des r{\'e}percussions sur la qualit{\'e} de l'engagement des enseignants. Peer assessment may involve increased time and workload for both students and teachers, and assessors may lack familiarity with necessary procedures and skill (Vu \& Dall'Alba, 2007). Sluijsmans and Prins (2006) stress that peer assessment skills are not easily and automatically acquired. They are complex skills and hence, adequate time is needed to prepare, train, and monitor assessors in order to foster adequate mastery (Sadler, 1998; Sluijsmans, Brand-Gruwel, van [Van Merri]{\"e}nboer, \& Martens, 2004). Vu and Dall'Alba (2007) have argued that preparation should include providing both a rationale and skills training. Rationale should stress the values and benefits of peer assessment and underscore its potential outcomes on the learning process, while training should prepare peer assessors to use criteria and to develop their skills in judging standards and in giving and receiving feedback ([Sambell] et al., 2013; Sluijsmans et al., 2004; Sluijsmans \& Prins, 2006). Students, when they take on the assessment role, need to be familiarized with assessment criteria, either through training or through involvement in developing and negotiating these criteria (Sluijsmans et al., 2004), and they will need practice in and feedback on how to use the standards and criteria. The referred peer assessment literature seems mainly to focus on training students as part of implementing peer assessment. However, it is reasonable to assume that teachers also need preparation before implementing peer assessment, preparation focusing on the rationale behind both the activity and the skills related to peer assessment orchestration.;This article focuses on teachers' experiences in implementing peer assessment with first semester students. It explores the relationship between teachers' conceptions of teaching and their approach to peer assessment, where both conceptions and approaches are described as being either learning focused or content focused. Drawing upon analysis of interviews with eight teachers, the study found that one had a consonant view of the interrelationship between conceptions of teaching and approaches to peer assessment, while the remaining seven described their conceptions of teaching and their approaches to peer assessment with a combination of learning-focused and contentfocused statements. These statements are labelled as dissonant. Discussion focuses on implications of consonant and dissonant relationships between conceptions of teaching and approaches to peer assessment for implementation of peer assessment; it also addresses academic development issues. The study reveals that when implementing new methods (here, peer assessment), underlying assumptions will impact on the nature of teacher engagement.;},

  abstract = {Contribution: This article is centered on effects that the COVID-19 lockdown has produced on the student performance in specific engineering course. The study treats to evaluate if the changes in the teaching and student assessment have been suited. Background: Most of higher education courses have had to adapt to this situation and made quick changes in its teaching and evaluation. The course applied computing was not the exception and has to split into two blocks. Teaching and evaluation of the first block was given totally in-person with traditional methodology. On the other hand, the second block that was affected by the lockdown, was fully taught with online flipped classroom (FC) teaching and remote assessment. Research Questions: This has given the opportunity to analyze how these changes have affected the student performance and what benefits of incorporated online FC teaching have been produced in this course. Methodology: The reliability of tests and item analysis techniques have been employed to measure the consistency and the item difficulty of the performed tests, respectively. From this psychometric study, the quality of the methodology of student assessment can be established. The study is also applied to the previous year where the in-person traditional methodology was employed. Moreover, the effectiveness of the teaching methodology is analyzed with student surveys. Findings: The reliability of online student assessment for FC teaching is high, yet when compared with traditional assessment for this specific course in both analyzed years. The different level of item difficulty is constant in the first block, being a possible cause for the low reliability of the test. Moreover, student surveys and student performance suggest that the online FC teaching method can be suitable for this specific course, and can be applied in the future.},

This article presents how one institution paired an online survey of instructors with a more traditional direct assessment to conduct a comprehensive assessment of oral communication in a General Education program, illuminating both how students are performing and how instructors are teaching oral communication. Detailed methodology and a full survey instrument are provided so that readers can translate this model to assessing oral communication or other major competency areas at their own institutions. Highlights of the survey results are also presented. The authors ultimately explain how the survey has led to faculty development around oral communication and to new oral communication resources that are aligned with the specific obstacles identified by survey respondents. They also describe how survey results helped to further explain the findings of the direct assessment.},

In particular, the consideration of a student's environment is presented as a novel finding in comparison to previous literature.

The results of this conceptual analysis allow concluding that some academics may perceive the requirements for online engagement as excessive. These academics question the confidence they have in their institution and, consequently, the psychological contract itself and the distinction between professional life and personal and family life, which they may perceive as a new form of control and monitoring. However, it is worth highlighting the difference in expectations between academics themselves, caused, among other factors, by the type of contractual experience and by their digital literacy, as well as by their ideological representations about the academic profession and, consequently, in the relative importance of their professional autonomy. In this scenario, the pre- and initial organizational socialization processes are critical in the (re)definition of the psychological contract of scholar's online organizational engagement in the context of higher education sustainability.},

They should lead the way in the design of teaching strategies that promote knowledge building. Personal learning environments (PLE) represent a groundbreaking new development in educational practices through the incorporation of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), and an opportunity to promote the creation of universities without walls able to meet the demands of the knowledge society. This study focuses on the relationships established by the participants (students and teachers) in two higher education instructional sequences using institutionally-powered PLE (iPLE). One of the sequences was carried out at the University of Barcelona and the other at the University of Andorra. Both used the same technological support, the "Elgg" platform, which allows users to build their own personal work and learning environment. The main hypothesis of the study is that the relationships formed depend on the techno-pedagogical design of the teaching and learning process. The results show that in both cases the relationships that the participants establish with their peers and teachers are indeed related to the characteristics and requirements of the particular techno-pedagogical designs. Although the technological environment allowed all the participants to establish relationships with others, the main interactions were found in small working groups created to carry out learning and assessment activities. In conclusion, we stress the importance of planning teaching and learning activities and assessment processes that are able to exploit the full potential of PLE.},

  abstract = {Academic integrity is at the heart of excellent education. However, resources explaining the concept tend to be definition-driven, while using complex language and sometimes even an austere tone designed to discourage students from breaches. This study aims to design and evaluate an online module at a UK University across 2 years, designed to improve students' understanding of concepts of academic integrity and practice. The module includes a range of interactive resources (e.g., gamified quizzes and e-booklets) and was made available to a large cohort of postgraduate students (448). The study adopts a mixed-methods approach composed of three sequential phases involving first collecting students' views on existing academic integrity resources (7 students participating in a focus group and 39 competing a questionnaire), then developing a range of new ones based on students' feedback to form the content of the module, and finally gathering students' evaluation on the newly created resources (sample size: 361 students). Results illustrate a clear improvement in relation to the accessibility, usefulness and understandability of new resources. Results also highlight a remarkable increase in student confidence levels regarding academic integrity. Students also considered the new module as more appealing and informative. This manuscript offers a good example of a pedagogical approach aimed at promoting academic integrity in an innovative and engaging fashion.},

  abstract = {\textbf{ }The area of learning has a justifiable claim to be a special case in how it can be enhanced or supported by~technology. In areas such as commerce and web design the aim is usually to ensure efficiency and support~specific actions such as purchasing or accessing information as quickly and easily as possible. Working~with technology for the purpose of learning, the user is expected to spend time facing challenges,~struggling through them and in almost every case the interaction with the technology is only one of~many influences in achieving success. This does not mean that computing and the Internet has not had a~major impact on how we learn and the choices available to learners. On the contrary, the area of formal~learning is undergoing a period of rapid change, and the barriers between formal and informal learning~are showing signs of falling away, in part due to the changes in the access to information or alternative~modes of delivery.The influence of technology on pedagogy (the manner or structure of teaching) is complex. There is~relatively little direct research on the ways that technological possibilities and the pedagogical response~to these operate to benefit the lifelong learner. In this article we are bringing together the evidence from~strands of research based on work in online and distance learning in formal settings, and also on open~and free online education, which is often less formal. This research sheds light on several factors relevant~to the outcomes of instruction: the often unpredictable motivations of learners, the trajectories they~take through courses, and the indicators for success in formal and informal learning, in terms of both~pedagogy and technology. We present the outcomes of practical endeavours to widen access to education~using technology which indicate that open education is offering alternative ways of supporting learners.~These suggest a focus on design decisions that can help integrate the process of learning more closely~with ways in which online systems currently support learning and the data that can be used to interpret~how well those designs are working.}

  abstract = {This chapter proposes a framework for integrating two different approaches to twenty-first century skills: ``working backward from goals'' and ``emergence of new competencies.'' Working backward from goals has been the mainstay of educational assessment and objectives-based instruction. The other approach is based on the premise that breakthroughs in education to address twenty-first century needs require not only targeting recognized objectives but also enabling the discovery of new objectives---particularly capabilities and challenges that emerge from efforts to engage students in authentic knowledge creation. Accordingly, the focus of this chapter is on what are called ``knowledge building environments.'' These are environments in which the core work is the production of new knowledge, artifacts, and ideas of value to the community---the same as in mature knowledge-creating organizations. They bring out things students are able to do that are obscured by current learning environments and assessments. At the heart of this chapter is a set of developmental sequences leading from entry-level capabilities to the abilities that characterize members of high-performing knowledge-creating teams. These are based on findings from organization science and the learning sciences, including competencies that have already been demonstrated by students in knowledge-building environments. The same sources have been mined for principles of learning and development relevant to these progressions.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we explore academic identity, specifically the identity of the educator in higher education and academics' conceptualisations of the digital educator. We suggest that the concept of a digital educator is not only about technology, tools and uses. The context for this exploration is academics' participation in an online professional development module, Digital Education, and the "pivot online" (Weller, 2020a) during campus closures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Through qualitative research, we explored participants' sense of teaching identity, whether they had or have a concept of being a digital educator and the extent to which these identities might have shifted while the campus closure continued. We present analysis of their accounts and reflect on the implications of this analysis, particularly in relation to organisational digital capacity defined as "the skills, competencies, attitudes, infrastructure, and resources that enable people to work, live and learn in a world that is increasingly digital world" (National Fonun, 2018, p. iv). We consider how higher education institutions will cope with the complex challenges facing us and suggest ways in which the implications of this research could better enable institutions to navigate change and build organisational digital capacity. Implications for practice or policy: The pivot to online teaching and assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic has had complex effects on professional identities which need to be researched and understood. Programme teams in campus based institutions have experienced erosion of professional nonns and relationships. They need support and leadership during the gradual return to campus. Faculty integrated technologies rapidly but unevenly into practice; therefore, the ongoing building of digital capacity and the shift towards post-digital pedagogies needs dedicated support and leadership.},

The first research perspective, which has been established for some time, deals with technology-enhanced learning. It primarily examines learning processes and outcomes as a function of media characteristics and individual learner characteristics. This research tradition has produced numerous findings. However, the question of how to integrate digital media into the classroom in a way that is effective for learning is not considered here. This is where the second, more recent research perspective on technology-enhanced teaching comes in, which addresses teaching with digital media and the professional competencies of teachers required for this. Finally, the paper argues for combining both research perspectives, especially since they have relevant commonalities in their basic assumptions. Thus, in both research perspectives, digital media are analyzed less on the basis of surface features, but rather in terms of their functions for the promotion of learning and teaching processes.},

Asking critical questions is not only a valuable dimension of media literacy, but also an indispensable aspect of participating in a democracy. Yet, measuring the effectiveness of media literacy is still a major challenge for the field. It is unclear to what extent people of all ages may engage in critical questioning habits with regards to media. To address this gap, we studied the changes in critical questioning habits for college-aged students enrolled in media literacy courses. To measure students' media literacy inquiry, we evaluated the questions they posed in response to viewing an advertisement. We analyzed questions by media literacy concept and by level of complexity before and after their participation in the media literacy courses. Findings revealed that after the media literacy courses, students' inquiries were more complex and involved more attention to key concepts related to production techniques and representations. Our study is significant as it reflects an innovative approach to media literacy assessment and a fresh perspective for examining the impact of media literacy on cultivating complex, critical thinking skills that could be applied with learners of all ages.},

The purpose of this article is to present a critical review of the literature from the past 5 years related to how web-conferencing software, blogs, wikis, social networking sites ( Facebook and Twitter ), and digital games influence student engagement. We prefaced the findings with a substantive overview of student engagement definitions and indicators, which revealed three types of engagement (behavioral, emotional, and cognitive) that informed how we classified articles. Our findings suggest that digital games provide the most far-reaching influence across different types of student engagement, followed by web-conferencing and Facebook . Findings regarding wikis, blogs, and Twitter are less conclusive and significantly limited in number of studies conducted within the past 5 years. Overall, the findings provide preliminary support that computer-based technology influences student engagement, however, additional research is needed to confirm and build on these findings. We conclude the article by providing a list of recommendations for practice, with the intent of increasing understanding of how computer-based technology may be purposefully implemented to achieve the greatest gains in student engagement.},

Openness is often deeply embedded in information technology (IT) and can be both a driver for and a result of innovative IT. To clarify the concept of ``openness'', we provide an overview of the scope of cross-disciplinary research on openness. Based on this overview, we develop a framework of openness, which proposes a higher-order concept of ``openness'' characterised by transparency, access, participation and democracy. The framework further distinguishes open resources, open processes and the effects of opening on particular domains. To provide the historical context and to appreciate the role of IT in openness, we discuss two historical examples of openness: the introduction of an open science model in academia (openness without IT) and the emergence of open source software development (openness with IT). We conclude by highlighting some concerns with and limitations of ``openness''.}

The vast majority of white-collar jobs will demand the efficiencies and flexibilities defined by generative AI now and in the future. As higher education institutions, we will be called upon to document and validate generative AI skills.},

We were motivated to inquire into authentic assessment through a work-readiness lens, with the goal of embedding the assessment of skills that are transferable across a range of STEM roles and graduate roles requiring STEM skills. The findings from the project included overlapping perceptions of what is considered 'authentic' for staff and students. Four shared themes were: assessments that 1) demonstrated skills that will be used in future workplaces, 2) tested scientific concepts (not memorisation), 3) involved using critical thinking or problem-solving skills, and 4) included student choice or input into the assessment. We consolidated shared facets of these themes with the literature to define authentic assessment in our context. Based on the resulting operational definition, we built an online tool to allow academic staff to self-assess the inclusions and levels of authenticity in their assessment tasks. We further investigated some obstacles related to assessment design and delivery for science academic staff. This study sheds new light on the lived experiences of practicing academic staff in applying their visions of authentic assessment to improve outcomes for science graduates.},

In a thoroughly revised edition of this successful book, Neil Selwyn takes a critical look at some of the major current debates and controversies concerning digital technologies and education. Focusing on the social as well as the technical aspects of these issues, Selwyn addresses fundamental but often unvoiced questions about education and technology. Over the course of eight chapters, the book gives careful thought to the people, practices, processes and structures behind the rapidly increasing use of technologies in education, with an emphasis on the implications of digital technologies for individuals and institutions. Brand new chapters on trends in AI and 'big data' driven automation of education, and the future(s) of education and technology are included. This edition also features new sections exploring 'post-digital' perspectives, personalized learning, digital labour, and the impending need for sustainable forms of digital education. The book focuses attention on the connections between recent technology developments and broader changes in education practice, education policy and education theory over the past few decades. It also challenges us to reflect on future directions and controversies for education in the (post)digital age. Expanded study questions, annotated further reading and a new glossary of key terms are included to support readers.

Following the theoretical tradition of media `domestication', this article examines the mainstream adoption of different online proctoring systems in Australian higher education during the first year of the pandemic. Through analysis of interviews, documents, news, social media and marketing materials, the article examines the `appropriation', `objectification', incorporation' and `conversion' of proctoring technology from the perspective of commercial providers, university authorities, university staff and student groups. This raises a number of critical issues underpinning the adoption of this exam surveillance technology -- not least the surrender of control to commercial providers, the hidden labour required to sustain `automated' systems and the increased vulnerabilities of `remote' studying.},

  abstract = {Despite huge efforts to position information and communication technology (ICT) as a central tenet of university teaching and learning, the fact remains that many university students and faculty make only limited formal academic use of computer technology. Whilst this is usually attributed to a variety of operational deficits on the part of students, faculty, and universities, this paper considers the wider social relations underpinning the relatively modest use of technology in higher education. The paper explores how university use of computer technology is shaped into marginalized and curtailed positions by a variety of actors. From the `writing' of ICT at a national policy level through to the marginalization of ICT within the lived `student experience', a consistent theme emerges where computer technology use is constructed in limited, linear, and rigid terms far removed from the creative, productive, and empowering uses which are often celebrated by educational technologists. In the light of such constraints, the paper considers how these dominant constructions of a peripheral and limited use of ICT may be challenged by the higher education community. In particular, it concludes by reflecting on current critical thinking about how educational technologists can foster a more expansive and empowered use of computer technology within university settings.},

All of the higher education institutions in Turkey have completed 2019-2020 Spring semester using online tools. However, most of these institutions were not fully-prepared to have all of their courses online. Technical inadequacies, lack of qualified online tools, inexperience of instructors and students in distance education have emerged as major issues that institutions have to face. In addition to all, a new question arised; which approaches will be used for assessment. This study aimed to seek the common assessment approaches used through pandemic, how students perceived the quality of the assessment and the pros and cons of using these practices. Additionally, we examined whether participants' perceptions about quality of the assessment differ according to interaction with faculty members and use of online tests. Researchers employed survey design to reply four research questions and used a three-part instrument to collect qualitative and quantitative data. 486 students from 61 universities voluntarily participated in the study. Results indicated assignments are the mostly used tools and students are generally satisfied about the quality of the assessment practices. Another result is that students who interact with faculty members are more satisfied with the quality of the assessment practices. This emphasizes the importance of formative assessment and feedback in remote assessment. Further, students who took online tests are more satisfied with the quality of assessment. Suggestions were made for future research.},

However, the quality of distance education and learning outcomes have become a matter of ongoing debate. Just as higher education aims to develop high-level skills in its students, researchers are seeking ways to perform valid and reliable assessment in distance education. Institutions and educators are also in search of assessment tools that can help prevent instances of cheating and plagiarism. However, performance-based assessment tools may also offer options to measure both high-level skills and in limiting cheating behaviors. In this study, we used the take-home exam as a formative remote assessment tool as a local case in Turkey. We surveyed the views of 43 undergraduate students about the quality of take-home exams as a remote assessment tool. The results showed that participants had a high quality perception about the use of take-home exam, especially with regards to being kept informed about evaluation and scoring, rapid assessment, the provision of feedback, and consistency of scope between assessment and course content. Whereas students highly perceived the use of take-home exams, they reported more moderate views regarding take-home exams increasing the level of interaction with their peers. The results of this study suggest that the use of take-home exams is significantly preferred by higher education students, that it is a reliable and distinctive way to measure students' academic performance, and may increase student-teacher interaction through its formative use.},

As teachers continue to learn about working in this new environment, research in cognitive and learning sciences, specifically findings from cognitive load theory and related areas, can provide meaningful strategies for teaching in this ?new normal?. Objectives This paper describes 12 tips derived from contemporary research in educational psychology, focusing particularly on empirically supported strategies that teachers may apply in their online classroom to ensure that learning is optimized. Implications for Practice These strategies are generalizable across age groups and learning areas, and are categorized into one of two themes: approaches to optimize the design of online learning materials, and instructional strategies to support student learning. A discussion follows, outlining how teachers may apply these strategies in different contexts, with a brief overview of emerging efforts that aim to bridge cognitive load theory and self-regulated learning research.},

The potential harm that these trends have on `learning' should be resisted by educators and students alike. Critical Pedagogy approaches offer one way of conceptualising and implementing such resistance in the interests of `authenticity' in learning. However, the issue becomes sharpest at the point of assessment. Here, the ideals of Critical Pedagogy can collide with student expectations of final degree success. By addressing the question of `authenticity' for assessment in relation to Critical Pedagogy, this article explores the challenges posed by this conundrum and draws upon interviews conducted with module leaders who apply recognisably (although not explicitly) Critical Pedagogy principles in their teaching and in the types of assessment they use. The themes that emerged present a picture of the kinds of potential that Critical Pedagogy influenced forms of assessment have for supporting authenticity in learning, as well as the difficulties involved in its application. It also helps to trace out the possible boundaries for further inquiry.},

  abstract = {Alternative grading practices are often used in authentic learning environments where the focus is on connecting instruction to real-world issues, problems, and applications. Scholarly literature lacks research studies related to teacher perceptions of alternative grading to support authentic learning. The purpose of this basic qualitative study was to explore the perceptions of high school science teachers regarding their use of alternative grading to support authentic learning, student self-reflection, and student articulation of their learning. The conceptual framework for this study was based on Herrington and Oliver's instructional design framework for authentic learning environments. The focus of the research questions was on how high school science teachers perceive their implementation of alternative grading as a support for authentic learning, student reflection, and student articulation of their learning. Data were collected from 11 high school science teachers using qualitative interviews. Participants were selected through the purposeful sampling method. The data collected were then coded by hand and using qualitative data analysis software to discover emergent themes. Findings indicated that educators perceived their use of alternative grading, student self-reflection, and articulation opportunities to be essential for supporting student learning in an authentic learning environment. This study may contribute to best practices in education by providing school district administrators with information they can use to develop professional development for new teachers that is focused on alternative assessment strategies. With this knowledge, educators may be more empowered to provide education that prepares students for real-world challenges.},

As a way to support student learning, Guskey, Journal of Advanced Academics, 19(1), 8-31 (2007) emphasizes the importance of not only frequent feedback but specific feedback. In order to examine how students are using feedback to inform their coursework within a digital badge context, an online survey was designed consisting of open-ended questions about the nature and value of instructional feedback within a digital badge system. Results from the questionnaire indicated three major thematic groups illustrating feedback from the students' perspective: Importance and Nature of Feedback, Authority over Knowledge and Learning, and Learning for Mastery.},

Furthermore, with thousands of studies using these theories, their contribution to knowledge has reached a plateau. In this commentary, we discuss some of the criticism of TAM and UTAUT, and argue that biomedical informatics research would benefit from shifting attention from these theories to multi-dimensional approaches that can better capture the complexity of issues surrounding implementation and use of HIT.

For example, flipped teaching pedagogy encourages the students to engage in the various in-class activities rather than just to be a passive learner by listening to the lectures. On the other hand, newly joined students have trouble understanding the key modules since they don't know the fundamental concepts related to the modules. This paper illustrates how online quiz creators and education tools might improve the student performance in academic setup. The online quiz creator has numerous styles, including photo quizzes, team quizzes, one-page quizzes, image quizzes, memory games, and match games for dynamic, energetic, and passionate student engagement. Students may self-assess their progress using ICT-based online quizzes. This platform assists with student engagement and learning to make them active learner. Students are greatly motivated by various learning styles and technology that suits them. This also has helped the students to avoid a random online tool and join a safe environment to enhance their learning. Supporting multiple learning styles is one of the techniques that should be implemented in every module delivery. The effectiveness of using these practices in teaching is measured through student feedback. Based on their responses, it is concluded that many benefits are found by adapting these practices, such as students' increased interest in their modules, improved understanding skills, and relational abilities.},

In addition, the study explores evidence of bona fide challenges that impede the implementation of assessment in VLE for both formative and summative purposes, and it attempts to propose some pragmatic solutions. Background: Assessment of student performance is an essential aspect of teaching and learning. However, substantial challenges exist in assessing student learning in VLEs. Methodology: Data on faculty's perceptions were collected using an e-survey. Ninety-six faculty members took part in this study. Contribution: This paper contributes to COVID-19 research by investigating preparedness of IHE for assessment in VLEs from faculty members' perceptions. This practical research explores deleterious challenges that impede the implementation of assessment in VLE for both formative and summative purposes, and it proposes effective solutions to prevent future challenges. These solutions can be used by IHE to improve the quality of assessment in VLEs. Findings: The findings revealed that IHE were not fully prepared to provide a proper assessment in a VLE during the lockdown, nor did they have clear mechanisms for online assessment. The findings also showed that faculty members were not convinced that e-assessment could adequately assess all intended learning outcomes. They were convinced that most students cheated in a way or another. Additionally, faculty had other concerns about (1) the absence of advanced systems to prevent academic dishonesty; (2) insufficient qualifications of some faculty in e-assessment because most of them have never done it before, and e-assessment has never been mandated by the university before the pandemic; and (3) insufficient attention paid to formative assessment. Recommendations for Practitioners: It is recommended that decision makers help faculty members improve by continuous training on developing e-assessment tests for both formative and summative assessments. Decision makers should also ensure the inclusion of technology-based invigilation software to preclude cheating, make pedagogical and technical expertise available, and reconsider e-assessment mechanisms. Faculty members are recommended to attend training sessions if they do not master the basic skills of e-assessment and should devise a variety of innovative e-assessments for formative and summative purposes. Recommendations for Researchers: More similar work is needed to provide more solutions to the challenges identified in this paper regarding the e-assessment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Impact on Society: The study suggests introducing technology-based solutions to ensure e-assessment security, or holding tests in locations where they can be invigilated whilst rules of social distancing can still be applied. Future Research: Future research could suggest processes and mechanisms to help faculty develop assessment in VLEs more effectively.;},

These tools often integrate several cognitive learning strategies within an assessment, with the goal of actually enhancing learning, as opposed to just measuring it. In the current study, students' level of engagement and test performance using a recently developed online application were compared to their final multiple-choice paper-and-pencil exam mark to determine the efficacy of the new online application in achieving improved learning outcomes. Results indicated that students had high test scores using the online tool despite their limited engagement in the cognitive learning features, calling into question the online cognitive assessment tool's facilitation of long-term learning. Implications and recommendations for future online cognitive assessment application implementation in educational environments are discussed.},

It presents a selective review of the literature concerned with critical thinking and/or interaction during online discussion. It reports a program of 5 studies of the effects of instructional media and instructional methods on critical thinking and interaction. Study 1 tests the influence on critical thinking of online vs. face-to-face discussion, individual vs. group consensus in summarizing discussion, and discussion of examples of concepts vs. discussion of more abstract analysis. Study 2 examines the relationship between the level of critical thinking in discussion and the quality of papers later written by discussants. Study 3 explores the question: Can a teaching assistant (TA) help to facilitate student-to-student interaction and critical thinking? Study 4 asks: Does personal relevance of discussion topic influence student participation and level of critical thinking in discussion online? Study 5 asks: Does the use of rubrics influence the level of student interaction and/or the level of critical thinking in online discussion? The evidence suggests that it is easier to influence students to interact than to think critically. The chapter offers some suggestions on how to increase student-to-student interaction and critical thinking.}

Further work to understand how this hegemonic masculinity impacts teachers is also proposed.},

Qualitative analysis of interview data from a nationally representative sample of 50 district testing directors revealed that approximately half of the measurement specialists operate from implicit learning theories that advocate, first, close alignment of tests with curriculum and, second, judicious teaching of tested content. Historical quotations are used to show that these beliefs, associated with criterion-referenced testing, derive from behaviorist learning theory, which requires sequential mastery of constituent skills and explicit testing of each learning step. The sequential, facts-before-thinking model of learning is contradicted, however, by a substantial body of evidence from cognitive psychology. Implicit beliefs should be made explicit because an understanding of learning theory assumptions is fundamental to evaluating evidence of testing effects and therfore to framing validity investigations.},

Consequently, Work Integrated Learning (WIL) has been adopted to enhance the workplace skills and professional networks of students to improve graduate employability. While WIL can take many forms, experiences located in workplaces (placements, internships) have been popular. The introduction of the Australian Government's Fair Work Act 2009 required that placements be tightly embedded within curriculum thereby presenting the challenge of how to enable WIL via placements and theoretical learning in already compact study programs. As a response, we present the pragmatic use of online theoretical instruction and online WIL assessment within an undergraduate core Capstone business subject, as an enabler of the WIL placement. We examine learner perspectives on, and grade outcomes from, undertaking online theoretical instruction concurrent with WIL placements to discuss the key WIL and online learning design implications for this cohort of learners. Our findings are increasingly pertinent given the 2017 Australian Government Higher Education Reform package incentivising the expansion of WIL into all degrees.},

How easy is it to prime for curiosity and what are its effects? What simple interventions can be used to enable curiosity-driven behaviors? We have conducted a large-scale study to address these questions, using a novel curiosity-based application (app) on university applicants. Using the same app, we addressed the issue of curiosity assessment, which in recent years has mainly been performed via self-reporting questionnaires. The curiosity assessment tool was developed in order to assess curiosity via an objective, quantitative and digital way. The tool measured several behavioral aspects during a free and task-less interaction with the tablet app. From the recorded activity logs we calculated quantitative behavioral measures related to their exploration patterns. We show that a single word can prime the participants and induce better learning of their self-explored knowledge. We also show that by simply enabling more time to explore, without the ability to stop at will, induces more exploration and more learning. Finally, we show that our behavioral measures, obtained with the digital quantitative assessment tool, are significant predictors of the participants' self-reported curiosity and Psychometric Entrance Test scores. These results suggest that simple priming for curiosity and enabling enough time to explore improve self-paced learning, and that a relatively simple and short interaction with a digital app can greatly improve state-of-the-art curiosity assessment.},

Moderator variable analysis suggested that social context, study design, and sample size were significant factors that influence the effectiveness of TE-ALE. TE-ALEs were found more effective when instructors employed individualized learning contexts as well as when bias was reduced in randomized controlled trials. TE-ALEs were also found to be more effective in small courses rather than in large courses.},

The results from multinomial logistic regression and OLS regression analyses showed that asking challenging questions increased both students' self-reported and the directly measured critical thinking abilities. Interpreting abstract concepts as well as giving well-organized presentation increased students' self-reported gains in critical thinking; however, these same practices did not significantly impact their CAAP scores. Inconsistent with previous literature, class presentations as well as group discussions decreased either students' self-reported or directly assessed critical thinking abilities.

  abstract = {[Although cognitive psychology currently represents the mainstream of psychological and educational thinking, it is only recently that much concern has been shown for learning as such -- that is, concern for the factors and/or variables that influence "changes" in human performance, knowledge structures, and/or conceptions. This article examines current thinking about learning within the framework of cognitive psychology and how a new, cognitive conception of learning can guide future research on both learning and instruction. Similarities and differences between behavioral and cognitive conceptions of learning are discussed, along with issues such as the active (rather than passive) nature of learning, the concern for understanding (i.e., comprehension), the role of prior knowledge, the cumulative nature of most forms of human learning, and the role played by cognitive analyses of performance. Several cognitive theories of learning are presented as examples of how cognitive psychology has influenced research on learning.]},

What  is  the  best  way  to  assess  and  support  new competencies?   This   paper   extends   current   thinking   about   educationally   valuable   skills   and instructional system design by identifying and modeling 21stcentury skills.The first stage (described in  this  paper)  of  our  multi-stage  research  involves:  (a)  conducting  an  extensive  literature  review  to identify a set of viable and valuable 21stcentury skills,and (b) modeling each in terms of constituent sub-skills,  at  a  sufficiently  refined  grain  size  so  that  we  can  measure  and  diagnose  competency levels. The competencies showcased in this paper include: systems thinking, creativity, collaborative learning, and  managing social  identities. Subsequent stages of this research will  include developing appropriate and engaging assessmentsto extract data on our relevant 21stcentury skills from students--individually  and  in  groups--during  interaction  with  immersive learning environments. Findings from  the second  stage  will then inform  the  third  stage  which  will  involve  adapting  existing (or developing  new)  learning environments  that  incorporate problems, assessments,  and instructional support in relation to our set ofimportant 21stcentury skills.},

We then describe how the frameworks of evidence-centered design and stealth assessment may be used to develop assessments that can be embedded in video games to make valid inferences about learners' competencies. We illustrate the process step-by-step with two projects in which we assess (a) problem solving skills with Plants vs. Zombies 2 and (b) creativity with Physics Playground. We discuss the methodological importance of and associated caveats for the use of external measures to validate in-game measurement. We conclude the chapter with a brief discussion of key future directions of stealth assessment in video games, which include valid actionable diagnoses of performance problems and provision of real-time feedback.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the flipped classroom has become prevalent in many educational settings. Flipped classroom adopts a pedagogical model in which short video lectures are viewed by students at home before class so that the teacher can lead students to participate in activities, problem-solving, and discussions. Yet the design or use of technology that employs planned instructional strategies with sustainable support of self-regulation is scant. We propose a technology-enhanced flipped language learning system (Flip2Learn) that provides facilitation and guidance for learning performance and self-regulation. A quasi-experimental study was carried out to examine whether Flip2Learn could enhance college students' self-regulatory skills and later contribute to the learning performance in the flipped classrooms. The results showed that Flip2Learn not only better prepared students for flipped classrooms but also better promoted learning performance compared to the conventional flipped classrooms. The results of this research advanced our understanding of the dynamics of flipped classrooms and represented a revolutionary new approach to the technology-enhanced learning for flipped classrooms. Lay Description What is currently known about the subject matter: Flipped classroom has been implemented in various disciplines and across different educational levels. Flipped classroom gives students more opportunities to participate in more interactive and higher-order activities. To fully participate in the flipped classroom, watching or listening to online materials is an essential part of flipped learning. What this paper adds to this: This study designed and implemented a technology-enhanced flipped language learning system (Flip2Learn) with self-regulated scaffolds to better acquaint students with flipped classrooms and to maximize the benefits of the flipped classroom. Students exposed to Flip2Learn not only showed better self-regulation skills, but also better readiness for subsequent flipped learning. Results from this study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing the Flip2Learn approach to facilitate low prior knowledge students' learning performance. The implications of study findings for practitioners: Results from this study implied that learning mechanism incorporating hard and soft scaffolds provide students with instant help and guidance helps students avoid feelings of isolation or a lack of motivation to learn. A focus on self-regulated learning can advance and deepen the learning in flipped classrooms.},

  abstract = {Predictions of the timelines for when machines will be able to perform general cognitive activities that rival humans, or even the arrival of ``super intelligence'', range from years to decades to never. For researchers in the education sector, the potential future state of AI, while provocative, is secondary to important shorter-term questions that influence how AI is integrated into learning and knowledge practices such as sensemaking and decision making. AI is not a future technology. It is already present in our daily lives, often shaping, behind the scenes, the types of information we encounter. It is, therefore, important to consider immediate questions surrounding the dynamics of human-machine interactions. In this paper, we focus on the relationship between human and artificial cognition and treat these as separate systems, each with distinct strengths and capabilities. We adopt a functional view (i.e., discrete tasks) of the activities that artificial cognition completes and those that are best handled by humans. This creates a foundation to then evaluate models for how these two cognitive systems interact and the mechanisms for coordination that are required. In doing so, we create a basis for future researchers to develop testable hypotheses regarding the impact of artificial cognition on knowledge processes such as learning, sensemaking, and decision making. Our evaluation provides insight for researchers regarding the optimal relationship between which cognitive activities should be handed off to the machine, which should remain the domain of human performance, and how these two should then be integrated when outputs are passed from one cognitive system (human or artificial) to the other.},

Thematic analysis found troublesome aspects to include instructor expectations, lack of consistency, differentiation of performance, student expectations, time constraints/workload, logistical/technological constraints and assessment policy. A belief in meaningful learning, embracing constraints and the desire to meet the needs of students, added to other enablers for assessment change, such as resources, support and strategic use of technology. Findings suggested assessment thresholds of constructive alignment and differentiation of standards. Reflection, collaboration and professional development were found to support the integration of assessment knowledge and build conceptual understanding of assessment thresholds. Authors recommend that higher education institutions provide academic staff with a foundation of conceptual understanding of these key areas to promote moves toward quality assessment practices.},

This article describes the process by which potential grand challenges were identified and subsequently evaluated by professionals in the field through a national survey. Results of the survey demonstrate broad support for the importance of four challenges: 1) Use assessment findings to increase equity; 2) Use assessment findings to direct immediate pedagogical improvements; 3) Produce visible and actionable assessment findings that drive innovation; and 4) Examine changes in institutional effectiveness (including student learning) over time.

In this context, quality is determined by what is most visible to external scrutiny, and accountability has become conflated with accountancy, giving rise to what researchers have called "audit culture" (Power, 1994; Shore \& Wright, 2004). This article explores how audit culture has emerged in higher education by critiquing the many ways in which it directs energy towards processes of compliance and by discussing how accountability might be reported without sacrificing quality. In the end, the authors propose strategies for navigating audit and accountability culture while meeting external requirements and maintaining the values and principles of higher education.},

Accordingly, a latent profile analysis was conducted using Mplus to identify these unobserved groups based on faculty (n~=~1148) members' responses to 12 items (6-point Likert scale) selected from the 2014 Faculty Survey of Assessment Culture. The resulting 4-class solution, including a previously unidentified group, was confirmed by the Lo-Mendell-Rubin Adjusted Likelihood Ratio Test: Culture of Student Learning (n~=~502); Evolving Student Learning Culture (n~=~398); Culture of Compliance (n~=~168); and Culture of Fear (n~=~80). Characteristics of each class are described and the prevalence of each class by type of degree granting institution and primary discipline is provided.},

  abstract = {The field of learning analytics has the potential to enable higher education institutions to increase their understanding of their students' learning needs and to use that understanding to positively influence student learning and progression. Analysis of data relating to students and their engagement with their learning is the foundation of this process. There is an inherent assumption linked to learning analytics that knowledge of a learner's behavior is advantageous for the individual, instructor, and educational provider. It seems intuitively obvious that a greater understanding of a student cohort and the learning designs and interventions they best respond to would benefit students and, in turn, the institution's retention and success rate. Yet collection of data and their use face a number of ethical challenges, including location and interpretation of data; informed consent, privacy, and deidentification of data; and classification and management of data. Approaches taken to understand the opportunities and ethical challenges of learning analytics necessarily depend on many ideological assumptions and epistemologies. This article proposes a sociocritical perspective on the use of learning analytics. Such an approach highlights the role of power, the impact of surveillance, the need for transparency, and an acknowledgment that student identity is a transient, temporal, and context-bound construct. Each of these affects the scope and definition of learning analytics' ethical use. We propose six principles as a framework for considerations to guide higher education institutions to address ethical issues in learning analytics and challenges in context-dependent and appropriate ways.},

The pattern of research findings supports the utility of cooperative learning methods in general for increasing student achievement, positive race relations in desegregated schools, mutual concern among students, student self-esteem, and other positive outcomes. The various cooperative learning methods are contrasted in terms of characteristics and outcomes, and the next steps for research in this area are outlined.},

Regardless, online education appears to be the darling of higher education leadership likely because it represented nearly three quarters of all enrollment increases last year. However, there is a gap in research regarding the human factor probably due to lack of measurability of the subject. The primary objective of this paper is to measure how the separation of teacher and student in online courses influences the student's perception of the quality of instruction. To measure students' perception, a survey based upon six statements was given to both face-to-face (FTF) and online as well as undergraduate and graduate. In every case, there was a significant difference in the means between online students and FTF students (both FTF and online undergraduate students plus FTF and online graduate students). This difference plainly favored FTF instruction for both undergraduate and graduate students. Additionally, of the six statements, the data demonstrated that instructor availability is the primary missing factor in online courses.},

However, family historians, particularly those from dominant social groups, usually end up interpreting their family story within dominant national narratives. As a form of "memory work" (Kuhn, 1995), family history has the potential to unearth hidden or "forgotten" memories about the past and its implication for the present. Drawing on theoretical tools of the critical theoretical traditions, critical family history interrogates the interaction between family and context, with a particular focus on power relationships among sociocultural groups. In this article, I use my own family history to illustrate the recovery of a silenced or suppressed national narrative. Specifically, through an examination of property records and wills, I show how social relationships that colonization forged, rather than being a relic of the past, live on in the present, and how family history can challenge a national mythology that minimizes the importance and ongoing impact of colonization.

However, various challenges arise during online assessment, which include reliability, when done without monitoring and practical concerns like Internet connectivity issues. This study was done to assess the medical students' perceptions of the reliability, usefulness, and practical challenges of online tests. One hundred first-year undergraduate medical students taking up online classes and tests in the subject of physiology were enrolled in this study. A questionnaire with items regarding practical challenges, reliability, and usefulness of the online tests, in general, and about different types of online assessment methods, in particular, were sent to the students online. Each item was rated on a five-point Likert scale, and the responses were analyzed anonymously. A large percentage of students used mobile phones (81.4\%) to undertake online tests. Although most students (73.2\%; P {$<$} 0.001) felt that online tests helped them substantially in learning the subject, network connectivity issues were considered to be a matter of serious concern (85.5\%, P {$<$} 0.001). Among the assessment methods used, viva voce by video conferencing was thought to be most reliable (83\%, P {$<$} 0.001). Multiple-choice question-based assessment when done online was felt to be more practically feasible with faster feedback than classroom assessment. The results of the study suggest that medical students find online formative assessments helpful for their learning, despite their concerns about reliability and practical challenges.},

This study uses a sequential mixed methods design to investigate students' conceptions about the purposes of assessment and their definitions of assessment. A questionnaire was administered to 599 lower secondary school students in Cyprus, followed by group interviews with 15 students to explain and build upon initial quantitative findings. Results show that students' perceptions are in alignment with the current shift in assessment to be used primarily for enhancing teaching and learning.

  abstract = {In this study, we applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques, within an educational environment, to evaluate their usefulness for automated assessment of students' conceptual understanding from their short answer responses. Assessing understanding provides insight into and feedback on students' conceptual understanding, which is often overlooked in automated grading. Students and educators benefit from automated formative assessment, especially in online education and large cohorts, by providing insights into conceptual understanding as and when required. We selected the ELECTRA-small, RoBERTa-base, XLNet-base and ALBERT-base-v2 NLP machine learning models to determine the free-text validity of students' justification and the level of confidence in their responses. These two pieces of information provide key insights into students' conceptual understanding and the nature of their understanding. We developed a free-text validity ensemble using high performance NLP models to assess the validity of students' justification with accuracies ranging from 91.46\% to 98.66\%. In addition, we proposed a general, non-question-specific confidence-in-response model that can categorise a response as high or low confidence with accuracies ranging from 93.07\% to 99.46\%. With the strong performance of these models being applicable to small data sets, there is a great opportunity for educators to implement these techniques within their own classes. Implications for practice or policy: Students' conceptual understanding can be accurately and automatically extracted from their short answer responses using NLP to assess the level and nature of their understanding. Educators and students can receive feedback on conceptual understanding as and when required through the automated assessment of conceptual understanding, without the overhead of traditional formative assessment. Educators can implement accurate automated assessment of conceptual understanding models with fewer than 100 student responses for their short response questions.},

While unfamiliarity with digital technologies may make the transition to online teaching difficult, the world's sudden dependence on distance learning has sparked the pressing need to implement virtual art education that is efficient and effective (Godvin, 2020). The three authors are all art educators who have been teaching virtual courses with a studio art focus in higher education for several years. In this article, based on their experiences, they share their collective insights on approaches to instruction, interaction, and assessment in virtual courses that might help other art educators avoid some of the common pitfalls of online teaching and achieve successful learning outcomes for their students. Each author describes the strategies she employed while teaching an online course and offers an analytical reflection. They end by offering the key learnings from their teaching experiences, examining how diverse students' needs could be met.},

Nine online instructors from seven institutions were interviewed for this grounded theory qualitative research. Three main aspects emerged from the analysis of the interviews that were involved in online assessment practices: student learning, instructional design, and interaction. The findings from this study suggested that online learning environments are uniquely different from the traditional classrooms, especially the forced nature of discussions and greater emphasis on interactions. In addition, the findings indicated that unique characteristics of online environments along with instructors' epistemic belief have an impact on course design and delivery.},

Students are able to use their mobile devices in the classroom, while teachers are able to use the tools for formative and summative evaluation purposes and for getting to know their students. Teachers also get feedback on their instructional practices by analyzing student responses. Previous studies found that undergraduate students in Faculty of Education in Turkey do not have a very positive attitude for geography courses, because most of the students take geography courses almost every year until they enter the university. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of in-class online assessment tools on the attitudes of students at undergraduate level towards geography courses. In addition, the changes in students' attitudes are examined for various variables. The study was designed in a quasi-experimental model with experiment and control groups. The study also implemented pre-tests and post-tests. Geography Attitude Scale developed by S{\"o}zen (2019) was used as data collection tool. The study's sample consists of 70 students whose majors are Primary School Teacher in Faculty of Education. An online assessment tool was implemented for seven weeks in experiment group, while the control group did not receive the said tool. The study found that using online assessment tools significantly improved students' attitude towards geography course.},

To determine whether college graduates possess the requisite knowledge and skills in DIL, higher education institutions must be able to administer and use results from valid assessments of DIL. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing definitions of this construct in major frameworks from higher education and the workforce and propose an operational definition of DIL. Next, we provide a review of existing assessments of information literacy and related constructs, including features of the assessments, construct alignment, and psychometric properties (i.e., reliability and validity evidence). Finally, we discuss challenges and considerations surrounding the design, implementation, and use of next-generation assessments of DIL. We offer this review as a resource for higher education institutions in selecting among existing assessments or in designing their own measures.},

All of the members of Thematic Working Group 5 (TWG5) have contributed to this synthesis of potentials, concerns and issues with regard to the role of technology in assessment as, for and of learning in the 21st century. The group decided to focus primarily on formative assessment rather than summative assessment and high stakes testing. Formative assessments and feedback provide an important opportunity to support and enhance student learning. Recognizing shifts in education towards blended and online learning with problem-based and inquiry-based approaches led to considerations of technologies that could effectively support formative assessment and informative feedback to 21st century learners. The paper concludes with a summary of conclusions and recommendations of the working group to be taken up in subsequent efforts.},

However, many teachers lack the time or resources to provide feedback on drafts. While research suggests that AI feedback is high enough quality to be used for draft feedback, especially when assignment-specific criteria are used (Steiss et al., 2024), it must be used in a human-centered process. AI has the potential to reduce educational equity gaps in writing support (Warschauer et al., 2023), but when narrowly implemented, technologies can deepen divides (Stornaiuolo, et al., 2023). Peer and AI Review + Reflection (PAIRR) combines peer review best practices with AI review in an approach that emphasizes student agency and reflection. Using a mixed methods approach, this study examined student perceptions of AI utility in the context of peer review. Results indicate that AI tools offer useful feedback when combined with peer review. Students found the similarity between AI and peer feedback reassuring, while also valuing their complementary perspectives. Moreover, by evaluating AI outputs, students developed AI literacy, gaining familiarity with AI feedback's affordances and limitations while learning ethical ways to use AI in their writing processes.},

Fifty-nine scientific publications were included in the review which analyses them through the lens of the value creation framework. Conference formats are undergoing innovations focussed on amplifying social learning, and the role of technologies to enrich this new landscape is being explored. Initial results indicated that while new practices are emerging, a coherent perspective on technology-enhanced continuing professional development to help understand and inform the transition towards learning conferences was lacking across the literature. For instance, traditional evaluations of conferences, such as satisfaction surveys applied by the end of the conference, are not yet taking into account the full range of possible values created through participation in conferences. In addition, results about the use of social media for community building and enduring professional development remain inconclusive, and a more guided approach towards the application of social media at academic conferences is needed. The Value Creation Framework seems to be an appropriate conceptual framework for understanding the impact of conference attendance for the development of (digital) professional competences of academics.},

We explored how faculty members tackled the task of adapting their assessment practices during the pandemic to identify what is required to sustain and favour future quality development and implementation of e-assessment in higher education. Employing a qualitative descriptive approach, we conducted semi-structured interviews with thirty-one individuals six months into the COVID-19 pandemic. We identified four major themes in participants' discourse about the integration of e-assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic: (a) the considerations they had for the potential consequences on students and how they considered this while deciding how to move forward, (b) the preoccupations for the potential for cheating, (c) the importance of pedagogical alignment, and (d) the affordances available to them. While the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the fact that higher education institutions were not prepared for a pivot to- or greater integration of- e-assessment, it also provided the tipping-point to do so. In other words, it offered an unprecedented opportunity to critically appraise and change assessment practices, this opportunity was also a very challenging balancing act of considering the social consequences of assessment, and the alignment within set affordances.},

This paper reports on an investigation that used data from Blackboard(TM) LMS to gain insight into the purpose for and practice of online tests at the Charles Darwin University (CDU) Business School in Australia. Focussing on curriculum and pedagogical practices, the paper identifies indications of good practice as well as potential issues related to curriculum mapping, including possible misalignment between learning outcomes and online tests. It also affirms the versatility of using data from LMSs in the study of e-assessment in general and online tests in particular. [Author abstract]},

Research surrounding open education has focused on adoption at the institutional level, identifying key enablers and barriers to practice, but the practicalities of engagement with open resources are not often addressed. By reviewing existing literature, and studying prior models used to explain OER (re)use, this article proposes a continuum of use model. The proposed model seeks to acknowledge the complexity of applied knowledge required to fulsomely engage with open education by examining practitioner behaviours and the necessary supporting mechanisms. This conceptual model aims to be of use to both practitioners and also those responsible for designing professional development in an educational setting. Whilst the proposed model is designed for teaching staff use, some discussion is given as to how it could be applied to student learning using open resources as well. [Author abstract]},

  abstract = {Some innovations change everything. The rise of personal computers in the 1970s decimated the mini-computer industry. TurboTax forever changed tax accounting, and MP3s made libraries of compact discs obsolete. These innovations bear the traits of what Harvard Business School Professor Clayton M. Christensen terms a "disruptive innovation." Disruptive innovations fundamentally transform a sector by replacing expensive, complicated, and inaccessible products or services with much less expensive, simpler, and more convenient alternatives. Online learning appears to be a classic disruptive innovation with the potential not just to improve the current model of education delivery, but to transform it. Educators and entrepreneurs are increasingly creating blended-learning environments--where rather than doing online learning at a distance, students learn in an adult-supervised school environment for at least part of the time. This paper profiles 40 organizations that have blended or have plans to blend online learning with brick-and-mortar classrooms. These represent a range of operators, including state virtual schools, charter management organizations, individual charter schools, independent schools, districts, and private entities. The organizations profiled in this paper are not a "top 40" list. Thousands of other schools are currently participating in blended learning and may have superior programs. Furthermore, this report does not provide a comprehensive market analysis, but rather a survey that offers a more intimate look at a small sample, with the intention to identify emerging models. Appended are: (1) List of programs by model; (2) Technology wish list; and (3) Policy wish list. (Contains 12 figures.)},

The purpose of the study was to determine which factors are most important among the three groups and where those perceptions converge since lack of convergence could be a factor resulting in high attrition rates of some online courses. While the results of this study indicated that the perceptions of administrators and faculty are more closely aligned than either is with the students' perceptions, they also show a recognition among all groups of stakeholders of online learning as an evolving phenomenon which requires attention to even the most minute details which are sometimes overlooked, not emphasized, or taken for granted. This recognition indicates a necessary paradigm shift, which will lead to improvements in online learning policy, design, and pedagogy, is in the making.},

Multiple-choice (MC) testing is common in introductory science courses, and students in these classes tend to associate memorization with MC questions and may not see the need to modify their study strategies for critical thinking, because the MC exam format has not changed. To test the effect of exam format, I used two sections of an introductory biology class. One section was assessed with exams in the traditional MC format, the other section was assessed with both MC and constructed-response (CR) questions. The mixed exam format was correlated with significantly more cognitively active study behaviors and a significantly better performance on the cumulative final exam (after accounting for grade point average and gender). There was also less gender-bias in the CR answers. This suggests that the MC-only exam format indeed hinders critical thinking in introductory science classes. Introducing CR questions encouraged students to learn more and to be better critical thinkers and reduced gender bias. However, student resistance increased as students adjusted their perceptions of their own critical-thinking abilities.},

The second study consists of four focus groups, which provides insights into students' perspectives and attitudes toward the use of social media by their educators in higher education. Results show that both educators and students acknowledge the importance of incorporating social media in delivery and assessment of courses and highlight its positive impact on students' deep learning experience and engagement, as well as their enhancement of collaborative and organizational skills. However, faculty is advised to keep a balance in terms of relevance of social media use, control, and usage level of social media platforms.},

Primary issues examined were: 1) awareness of instructors in EFL teacher preparation programs of standards assessment; 2) the degree to which the standards are assessed; and, 3) the degree to which assessment data is analyzed and acted upon. This study utilized the Instrumental Case Study combined with a mixed-method approach. Data was collected via survey and interviews. An internet-based survey was distributed to teacher preparation faculty members across Turkey. One-on-one structured interviews were conducted with instructors from EFL teacher preparation programs at public and private universities. Results indicate that despite relatively high levels of awareness among university faculty members and the standards established by the Turkish Higher Education Council, there is little evidence to suggest that assessment data is collected or acted upon.},

  abstract = {Australian law schools have just begun to move towards e-exams. There are a number of drivers encouraging Australian universities to introduce e-exams, including economic pressures, a desire to reduce administrative burdens, and changes to workplaces. Logistically, e-exams may assist with paper distribution, script legibility and shorter marking times.             Pedagogical arguments in favour of e-exams rely on the fact that students already use technology daily and complete the bulk of their university work on computers. In this context, handwriting an exam has been described as an `anachronism'. More specifically, traditional handwriting of examinations in contemporary contexts is seen as a `misalignment of assessment practice to the learning environment'. Such misalignment can result in diminished learning outcomes.             However, there is little literature addressing the adoption of e-exams for formal high stakes summative exams. Much of the research to date has focused on small scale, informal low stakes tests in non-law disciplines. Within Australia, whether e-exams are appropriate or effective has been the subject of a number of reported trials, but none have specifically reported on law students. In 2016 UNSW Law sought to rectify this and undertook such a trial.             This article provides empirical insight into the process and student perceptions for a high stakes summative e-exam. It analyses students' attitudes and concerns prior to the introduction of the e-exam platform, as well as after they had completed the exam. We also provide insights into the important procedural aspects associated with high stakes exams and staff responses to the process, issues not previously reported on.},

Applying the adapted participation gestalt framework to identify how a particular form of participation emerges, and how it is constituted, individual interviews and focus group meetings with 13 Danish students were carried out. The analysis highlights a number of signs accumulated by students to construct their participation in the interaction. These signs argue against simplistic accounts of student agency in educational research, whereby student agency is approached as an individual and cognitive phenomenon and relationships as stable and unproblematic. The paper argues that student agency should not automatically be assumed possible as part of digital education or digital student-centred learning activities. Instead, the social aspects of educational interactions need to be taken into consideration when presenting digital education as a means to enhance student agency.},

This review aims to summarise some research on e-assessment, providing an overview based on articles from three well-established scientific journals. Focusing on research topics, settings for e-assessment and research methods used in the articles, the review reveals a research field with a broad spectrum of inquiries and approaches. Research of e-assessment practices is often conducted as small-scale studies in which the e-assessment task comprises closed questions such as multiple-choice questions. The article discusses the findings to guide future research and concludes that there is a need for more studies on e-assessment in online courses as well as for longitudinal studies.},

This section of the Handbook of Academic Integrity, 2nd Edition, aims to describe how academic integrity can be promoted through ethical teaching and assessment. The authors outlined various approaches (e.g., authentic assessment, experiential learning, program-level course design, and accommodation) and practices (e.g., duplicate and salami publication) that demonstrate ethical professional practices within higher education. This overview chapter links the authors' chapters to the existing literature describing ethical care and principles of ethical teaching and assessment. An identification of the gaps in the literature about ethical teaching and assessment in higher education, directions for future research, and considerations for changes in approaches to fostering cultures of integrity close the chapter.},

This article discusses the perceptions of participants in a pilot digital badge program to identify important milestones, collaborative efforts, and barriers believed to be instrumental in designing a successful digital badge initiative through a school-university partnership. The purpose of this exploratory case study was to understand how students and members of a school-university partnership perceived the use of an earned digital badge to embrace the legitimacy of instructional technology competencies that can be used as career currency. Data collection included student and partner interviews, badge assessment results, and meeting documentation. Results of the study were framed using Rogers' (2003) innovation diffusion theory to identify the critical characteristics of the pilot digital badge initiative through a school-university partnership. Results found that relevance to professional opportunities, value to stakeholders, and sustainability plans contributed to relative advantage, compatibility, trialability, and observability. Additionally, results found communication and timing contributed to complexity barriers. Results of the current study will be used to further develop a successful digital badge initiative through an ongoing school-university partnership.},

  abstract = {Learning outcome assessment is a fairly recent trend in higher education that began in the 1980s (Lubinescu et al., 2001). Today, many faculty perceive assessment reporting to be tedious, time-consuming, and irrelevant busywork (Wang \& Hurley, 2012). Unfortunately, this systematic process created to use empirical evidence to measure, document, and improve student learning has in many cases lost sight of this central goal. As a result, faculty may be justified in their opinions about it. This essay proposes a framework for addressing this thorny issue via WISER. WISER is an acronym for five content pillars of the communication discipline faculty can use to ensure their assessment efforts achieve the goal of not only documenting but also improving student learning. WISER stands for writing, immersive experiences, speaking, ethical communication, and research as programmatic assessment categories. These WISER categories extend the National Communication Association (NCA)-endorsed domains of communication learning in ways that make them functional for assessment.},

However, it is unclear what alternative methodology would be useful to determine whether students have acquired the skills necessary for today's global market. This research study's purpose was to understand the processes instructors use when choosing and designing alternative assessments in higher education online courses to measure student performance. Using Gagn{\'e}'s conditions of learning and Bloom's Taxonomy as a framework to understand these processes, this qualitative case study examined 8 participants teaching online at Midwestern public universities. Interview data and course artifacts, including syllabi, rubrics, assessments, and grades, were gathered as evidence. These data were categorized by participant, interview question, and research question, and were then coded and analyzed to identify themes. The results indicated that, although objectives drive assessment indicators, they do not necessarily drive the assessment choice. They also indicated that the processes used by experienced instructors to determine assessment choices appear almost subconscious, although objectives are the major decision making point. This study impacts social change by helping identify areas where assessment selection is effective or ineffective, as well as where additional training needs to occur on alternative assessment options that accommodate changing student and workplace expectations better.},

The utilization of remote learning system has supported many lecturers in teaching and learning process. However, making an appropriate learning assessment is still an issue. This study was aimed to investigate the types of assessment techniques, learning platforms utilized by lecturers in assessing the students' performance, and challenges in assessing students online. Methodology: This is a mixed method study. The participants were 20 lecturers from any disciplines working in one state university in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The data were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. Findings: It was revealed that six assessment techniques were revealed including video projects, group presentations, essay writing, online tests, summarizing, and giving comments on online discussions. Moreover, seven learning platforms were found to be used by the participants with Zoom as the highest choice with 86.2\%. Last, three main challenges of assessing students online were uncovered through interview data which include lack of face-to-face interactions, lack of supporting teaching and learning facilities, and lack of students' integrity and honesty. Conclusion: Various techniques and platforms for students' assessments were used by lecturers. However, a number of challenges were also found to show that not only do online assessments provide positive but also negative contribution towards students' performance in assessments.},

Recent trends in assessment have migrated away from summative to formative evaluations. Formative evaluations help students develop expertise and concentrate their schedules, ease student anxiety, instill a feeling of ownership in students as they go, and confirm the module's subject notion. Online formative assessment (OFA) emerged as a result of the convergence of formative and computer-assisted assessment research. Bibliometric analyses provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of a study topic across a particular time period. We used a PRISMA-compliant bibliometric method. The Scopus database was searched for BibTex-formatted publication data. In total, 898 studies were analyzed. According to the results, Assessment \& Evaluation in Higher Education and Computers \& Education are the most influential sources. RWTH Aachen University and Universitat Oberta De Catalunya are the most effective institutions. The red cluster includes terms associated with higher education and evaluation. The word "e-assessment, e-learning, assessment, moodle" appears in the green cluster. This group is quite influential yet has a low centrality. The highest percentage is 79.2 for "online assessment". The subject is comprised of three components: "distance learning", "accessibility", and "assessment design". The most important topics were "e-assessment", "higher education", and "online learning".

We designed a series of online activities and evaluated how, where, and with what devices students used the activities, as well as their levels of engagement and deep learning with the activities. A mixed-methods design was used to explore students' interactions with the online activities. This method integrated learning analytics data with responses from 63 survey, nine interview, and 16 focus group participants. We found that students used a combination of mobile devices to access the online learning activities across a variety of locations during opportunistic study sessions in order to fit study into their daily routines. The online activities were perceived positively, facilitating affective, cognitive, and behavioural engagement as well as stimulating deep learning. Activities that were authentic, promoted problem-solving, applied theory to real-life scenarios, and increased students' feelings of being supported were perceived as most beneficial to learning. These findings have implications for the future design of online activities, where activities need to accommodate students' need for flexibility as students' study habits become more mobile.},

However, in Universitas Terbuka with supposed to be the cyber university of Indonesia, the participation in the online tutorials was still not encouraging. For example, the average of the percentage of students' involvement in the first academic semester of 2017 to the 2nd semester 2018 for one course was 2.21\%. This study aimed to identify barriers for students to participate in the online tutorial. The method consisted of two stages. First, analyzing qualitative data that were gathered through open-ended questions to identify factors of the barriers. Second, developing 20 items' questionnaire based on the factors identified in the first stage and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM). The study involved 76 students in the first stage and 237 students in the second. The results of the study revealed that the students' barriers to online tutorial reflected in four factors, i.e. (1) information, (2) motivation, (3) technical, and (4) supports; each factor confirmed significantly (p-values {$<$} 0.05) with t-values equal to 14.108, 27.875, 7.502, and 25.640, respectively. The study proposed some recommendations to improve student participation in online tutorials.},

In order to ensure the quality of education, assessment should be performed as a platform to support student learning. The role of assessment also ensures that students' learning outcomes meet the needs of the 21st century skills. "Scratch \& Challenge Board" (SCB) can be used to support the 21st century teaching and learning environment through focus group discussions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the perspectives of university students on the use of "Scratch \& Challenge Board" as an alternative assessment tool in enhancing students' skills. This study applied the qualitative research approach. Data were collected through focus group interviews and related documents such as students' assignments. A total of 10 focus group were obtained, with 3-4 students in each group, and each discussion was moderated by an experienced moderator. Collected data were analysed using constant comparative data analysis methods to obtain the themes. Four (4) themes emerged in this study: (i) alternative assessment encourages active participation in learning, (ii) integrating technologies in assessment tools, (iii) relevant with 21st century skills, and (iv) improvement in learning environment. In conclusion, the "Scratch and Challenge Board" is an assessment tool that not only supports face-toface teaching and learning, but can also be integrated with technological devices and social media platforms. The "Scratch and Challenge Board" also enhances students' 21st century skills.},

  abstract = {Educational establishments continue to seek opportunities to rationalize the way they manage their resources. The economic crisis that befell the world following the near collapse of the global financial system and the subsequent bailouts of local banks with billions of tax payers' money will continue to affect educational establishments that are likely to discover that governments will have less money than before to invest in them. It is argued in this article that cloud computing is likely to be one of those opportunities sought by the cash-strapped educational establishments in these difficult times and could prove to be of immense benefit (and empowering in some situations) to them due to its flexibility and pay-as-you-go cost structure. Cloud computing is an emerging new computing paradigm for delivering computing services. This computing approach relies on a number of existing technologies, e.g., the Internet, virtualization, grid computing, Web services, etc. The provision of this service in a pay-as-you-go way through (largely) the popular medium of the Internet gives this service a new distinctiveness. In this article, some aspects of this distinctiveness will be highlighted and some light will be shed on the current concerns that might be preventing some organizations from adopting it.},

Successful online teaching requires careful thinking, planning, and technical and human support from teachers. Based on the reflection on the offline classroom teaching of theoretical mechanics for many years and the online teaching practice of first half of 2020, the author summarizes effective strategies for implementing online teaching of theoretical mechanics. We prepared the theoretical mechanical lessons through a "student-centered" approach, such as preparing teaching materials, students and teaching methods. These teaching strategies include (i) Adopting live-stream teaching as the main teaching method, (ii) Applying electronic blackboard to online deductions, (iii) Linking theory to practice for better understanding of knowledge, (iv) Integrating curriculum content in ideological and moral education, (v) Conducting formative assessment to supervise and motivate online learning. The implementation of these online teaching strategies has effectively promoted the development of students' independent learning ability.},

This article defines, characterizes, and describes a fifth form of interaction of particular importance to certain learners, especially within the context of computer-mediated communication (CMC). This newly defined concept is referred to as "vicarious interaction." During a pilot study, the author identified students as "direct interactors," "vicarious interactors," "actors," or "non-actors" (Sutton, 1999). Within this framework, the learning psychology associated with the process of vicarious interaction is comparatively analyzed. It is generally accepted that participatory interaction by students directly affects educational success; however, social and psychological characteristics of individual students often combine to inhibit their direct interaction. This article presents the principle that direct interaction is not necessary for all students, and that those who observe and actively process interactions between others will benefit through the process of vicarious interaction.},

We review extant artificial intelligence approaches that--at least partially--address these issues and critically discuss whether these approaches present additional challenges for assessment practice.},

  year = {2019},
  abstract = {Designing distance learning to ensure student success is of high importance and there are well-known aspects of distance online learning that encourage retention such as regular tutor support, clear structure, student self-reflection and online discussion with peers (Doig and Hogg, 2013). A module for a new Postgraduate Certificate in Learning and Teaching in Higher Education at the University of London was recently designed using these plus innovative pedagogic features to promote student success. The design included alignment between the assessment criteria and weekly discussion forum activities. An ipsative assessment criterion indicated to students that they must demonstrate their development and progress with their learning throughout the module to encourage consistent engagement. The design also included a peer review process that was managed through the Virtual Learning Environment with student reviews that were anonymised. To identify which aspects of the design promoted success, we collected data analytics for 50 students and explored links between online discussion forum participation, peer review activities and student marks. Contrary to popular expectations, engagement with the discussion forum is not a very good predictor of completion and success. By contrast, engagement in peer review, and especially giving feedback to peers, is a good predictor of success. Furthermore, early drop out from peer review links to incomplete submission of assessments. Thus, spending time on task in the peer review links to high or moderate performance, although a few exceptions indicate that different learners might use different tools for success. This study suggests a number of avenues for tutor development in online learning to encourage retention such as using peer review activities that are time bound and well organised. Assessment could include criteria for developmental progress as well as outcomes}

  abstract = {Problem-based learning (PBL) is an approach that improves students' skills in problem solving. The application of PBL as an approach of teaching in a class requires students' presence; such constraint cannot be fulfilled by all students. Therefore, it is important to avoid this problem by implementing an online PBL environment where students are grouped remotely and work together to solve a problem proposed by the teacher. This will guide the learning process of the learners and can evaluate their solution. In reality, we can find members who do not really contribute to solve a problem. From this point of view, the teacher's evaluation will not be adequate to estimate the contribution of the learner in the solution of a given problem. Therefore, it is important to think of another way for assessing learners' solution. So, the challenge is to implement an online PBL environment and to propose a new method for assessing students. In this paper, the authors present their system called Problearn. The developed system allows students to solve problems remotely in small groups. Furthermore, the system evaluates each student based on his behavioral profiles during the problem-solving process. To do so, the system must keep track of different actions carried out by the students. This system has been tested by students of a computer science department where they achieved very good results.

Yet in the research literature, class size is addressed with insufficient specificity to provide enrollment direction. Seeking guidelines for determining online class sizes, the authors conducted a qualitative research synthesis from 43 recent higher education journals, yielding 58 evidence-based articles. It is clear that no one size fits all. Findings reflect that large classes (= 40 students) are effective for foundational and factual knowledge acquisition requiring less individualized faculty-student interaction. Small classes (= 15 students) are indicated for courses intending to develop higher order thinking, mastery of complex knowledge, and student skill development. Pedagogical intent should dictate class size. Using well-established learning theories, the authors describe current understandings of online enrollments and propose an analytical framework for pedagogically driven, numerically specific class sizes. Highlights: (1) There is academic interest in online course sizes in higher education; (2) Research indicates "no one size fits all" online classes; (3) Class sizes should be based on learning level and identified pedagogical intent; (4) Large classes are appropriate for foundation-level learning; and (5) Small classes are appropriate for learning requiring higher order thinking.},

For this study, all students who took a Financial Accounting class in the academic year 2018--2019 at Lincoln University (LU) were video-recorded when presenting. Participants were asked to review their video recordings, assess their performance, and record their reflections by using a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ). The results indicated that the students' attitude toward recording the presentations was highly positive. The predominant response was that this new learning activity increased students' awareness of the importance of presentation skills without provoking their anxiety. Participants were able to observe that certain delivery skills such as good preparation, self-confidence, eye contact, and voice quality needed improvement. For managerial implications, LU, through its Writing and Speaking Center (WSC), offered thirty-minute sessions with a presentation coach to improve students' communication skills and prepare them to give a more polished presentation in class. In comparing the practice presentation at the WSC with the final in-class presentation, students were observed to be more confident, better prepared, and less nervous during the final presentation. However, we observed that the practice presentation did not carry the same weight as the final presentation as the practice presentation was neither graded nor delivered in front of an instructor or a wider audience.},

The study employed a mixed methods approach, collecting self-reported survey data, observations of, and reflective interviews with, the medical students observed. Participants were in their first year of clinical placements. Data were thematically analysed. Students indicated that PAL contributed to both the comprehension of notions of quality, and the practice of making comparisons between a given performance and the standards. Emergent themes included peer story-telling, direct observation of performance, and peer-based feedback, all of which helped students to define `work quality'. By participating in PAL, students were required to make comparisons, therefore using the standards of practice and gaining a deeper understanding of them. The data revealed tensions in that peers were seen as less threatening than supervisors with the advantage of increasing learners' appetites for thoughtful `intellectual risk taking'. Despite this reported advantage of peer engagement, learners still expressed a preference for feedback from senior teachers as more trusted sources of clinical knowledge. While this study suggests that PAL already contributes to the development of evaluative judgement, further steps could be taken to formalise PAL in clinical placements to improve learners' capacity to make accurate judgements on the performance of self and others. Further experimental studies are necessary to confirm the best methods of using PAL to develop evaluative judgement. This may include both students and educators as instigators of PAL in the workplace.},

A study-level metaanalytic validation was also conducted for purposes of comparison. An extensive literature search and a systematic review process resulted in the inclusion of 25 meta-analyses with minimal overlap in primary literature, encompassing 1,055 primary studies. The random effects mean effect size of 0.35 was significantly different from zero. The distribution was heterogeneous under the fixed effects model. To validate the second-order metaanalysis, 574 individual independent effect sizes were extracted from 13 out of the 25 meta-analyses. The mean effect size was 0.33 under the random effects model, and the distribution was heterogeneous. Insights about the state of the field, implications for technology use, and prospects for future research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Interactive oral assessments demonstrate potential to develop graduate attributes such as critical thinking, professional communication and collaborative skills in students through authentic simulation of workplace scenarios. This study captured the design, delivery and evaluation of interactive oral assessments across three programmes ? occupational therapy, nursing and air transport management ? in one university. A four-step Model to Build Authentic Assessment was used to design the assessments. Quantitative and qualitative data collected from 158 students, five assessors and three module leaders were analysed for a basic evaluation of the fidelity of interactive oral assessment implementation across different contexts and to explore the experiences of faculty and students undertaking the assessments. Fidelity was considered in terms of: (i) whether students could express their individualised responses, (ii) if they perceived the assessment to be authentic, and (iii) if it helped them gain professional knowledge and skills. In all the developed assessments, each of the three aspects were somewhat evident, evident or clearly evident. Qualitative findings suggested the interactive oral assessments reflected real-world expectations, promoted deep learning and offered a quality learning experience. From these results, practical suggestions for how faculty can self-assess their readiness for implementing interactive oral assessments are offered.}

How much does the basic infrastructure, such as Internet access, influence the awareness and acceptance of MOOCs? We believe the effectiveness and efficiency of MOOCs will be improved by understanding the answers to these questions. Our study explored the effect of cultural differences on course enrollment using power distance index, one of Hofstede's cultural dimensions. We looked into enrollment patterns and cultural beliefs of learners from 67 nations across three MOOCs offered by the Pennsylvania State University. The findings indicate that when the variable of Internet access for all countries is controlled, the PDI value of a country influences whether people from that country would register for MOOCs.},

Few nurse educators, however, have formal preparation in constructing multiple-choice questions. Consequently, questions used in baccalaureate nursing assessments often contain item-writing flaws, or violations to accepted item-writing guidelines. In one nursing department, 2770 MCQs were collected from tests and examinations administered over a five-year period from 2001 to 2005. Questions were evaluated for 19 frequently occurring item-writing flaws, for cognitive level, for question source, and for the distribution of correct answers. Results show that almost half (46.2\%) of the questions contained violations of item-writing guidelines and over 90\% were written at low cognitive levels. Only a small proportion of questions were teacher generated (14.1\%), while 36.2\% were taken from testbanks and almost half (49.4\%) had no source identified. MCQs written at a lower cognitive level were significantly more likely to contain item-writing flaws. While there was no relationship between the source of the question and item-writing flaws, teachergenerated questions were more likely to be written at higher cognitive levels ( p},

It investigates the effectiveness of a content-based English for specific purposes module in tertiary aeronautical engineering education, which incorporates recruitment advertisements as online resources. The study adopted a mixed-methods approach and surveyed three aeronautical engineering student groups (N = 141) over three consecutive years on their perceptions of the module's learning outcomes. This longitudinal survey was complemented by a teacher-assessed writing task and a qualitative content analysis of online recruitment advertisements (N = 80) in a self-built corpus. All three year groups rated the 10 questionnaire statements on a 5-point Likert scale rather equally, thus suggesting a similar perception of academic achievement stemming from the module's completion. This student view was supported by the results of the writing assignment. In short, the module's effectiveness was corroborated both quantitatively and qualitatively, which identifies this teaching concept as a feasible way forward.},

During the study, an E-learning model was conceptualized using coursework program instruction, testing academic performance, faculty experience, and assessment method as the determinants. The aim of this work is to develop a `University Communication (UCOM) model for improving the student's assessment method and evaluating their academic performance. In the first phase of this study, a systematic review of the existing literature was carried out to determine the suitable quantitative and qualitative criteria of feature selection, like student satisfaction and degree of learning. The next phase involved the generation of an E-learning model for assessing the feedback and approval processes. The final step is the design of the evaluation forms that can measure the satisfaction of the technology and enhance the assessment method. In this study, surveys were distributed to the students of Al-Buraimi University College (BUC), Oman, to assess their level of satisfaction in using a UCOM model which served as a link between them and the University. The results were tested for accuracy, reliability, and validity using smart PLS. The findings of this paper assisted positively in four of the deployed factors and approved the capability of the developed model in improving student's assessment feedback using E-learning.},

Due to recent pandemic and other factors, global Education System transiting from traditional paradigm to online paradigm in learning as well as assessment. Online proctored examinations have ensured continuity in assessing learners in award of various global certifications and university degrees. Traditional human proctored examination requires huge infrastructure, human resources, effort, and physical presence of examinees. To overcome these limitations, an automated AI-based proctoring system ``Proctor Net'' proposed in this work for detecting suspicious behavior of the examinee. The proposed system captures live video of the examinee and generate alerts based on three aspects, 1. Examinee Recognition, 2. Eye-gaze Tracking, and 3. Mouth Opening Detection. In first phase, Proctor Net recognizes examinee faces using inception-Resnet v1 blocks. In next phase, the Proctor Net calculates the pitch and yaw of the authenticated examinee face from the spatial landmarks extracted by hour-glass model. Further, Mouth Aspect Ratio was verified to check if examinee is speaking to others. The proposed model generate alters to proctor if found any deviation in examinee's behavior. The proposed Proctor Net is evaluated using standard data sets such as Labelled Faces in the wild Dataset (LFW), Unity Eyes Dataset and real time data - ``Proctor Dataset'' with various types of malpractices. Extensive experimentation is carried out and results demonstrate that proposed work with the combination of Inception-Resnet-v1 blocks with Hourglass modules is more accurate with an accuracy rate of 91\%, making it reliable and robust.},

Particularly, some assessment instruments, like the National Student Survey in the United Kingdom, reveal that evaluation and feedback are systematically among the areas that students are less satisfied with. The aim of this article is to describe the indirect feedback technique, which was devised and used by the principle author in his previous tenure as a professor at the University of Cadiz in Spain and to reflect on how it can be applied to overcome some of the limitations presented in a different context of practice. It is argued that indirect feedback meets many of the principles of good practice (facilitation of self-assessment skills, delivery of quality information about the students' learning, encouragement of dialogue, and improvement of teaching).},

  abstract = {Recent research points out a problem regarding the pre-service assessment education given by English as a Foreign Language (EFL) programs in the national context. One factor contributing to the problem can be the poor alignment among program components as numerous teacher education researchers assert that alignment is a necessary condition for learning experiences and practices of pre-service teachers. Accordingly, in this study, the author examined the alignment among the components of the pre-service assessment course curriculum; that is, the intended, enacted, assessed, and received curricula. The study adopted a mixed-methods case study approach using both qualitative and quantitative data collection tools, and to examine the alignment among the curricula, an adaptation of Surveys of the Enacted Curriculum (SEC) alignment methodology was used. Data for the intended and assessed curricula were collected through curricular and assessment documents and analyzed through content analysis, while the data regarding the enacted and received curricula were collected through surveys with teacher educators and pre-service teachers and analyzed through descriptive statistics. In both cases, the data were transferred to matrices for further analysis. To calculate the alignment among each pair of curricula, Porter's alignment index formula was used. Results indicated that the pre-service assessment course curriculum has moderate to high alignment indices ranging from 0, 44 to 0, 78. The study found a strong alignment between the intended and enacted curricula and the assessed and received curricula but a moderate alignment between each pair of the intended and assessed; enacted and assessed; enacted and received and intended and received curricula. The results of this study serve to identify the points of misalignment within the pre-service assessment curriculum. The study concludes with implications for improving the alignment in teacher preparation and suggestions for future research on pre-service assessment education.},

The research was undertaken using a quantitative methodology which collected and analysed data through questionnaires to find out how eLearning is used by 1302 lecturers of different level of six different Andalusian{\textasciiacute}s university, and to assess their levels of satisfaction with it. The university teaching staff demonstrated positive attitudes towards the e-learning and b-learning process, the methods used, the support offered by the university, and the development programme. The research demonstrates the success of the programme, and shows that it promotes diversity within the university by making use of a variety of personal and professional factors. It also confirms that the majority of teaching staff at the universities do not consider the use of different platforms to be a problem, and that the success of the experience is dependent on the support and attitudes of the university. We found significant differences between the lecturers in terms of gender in two areas: male lecturers had more knowledge of the tools, and female lecturers made more use of them.},

That is, perhaps, unless you work on open source software. Right now, global research communities are united to collaborate on solving the threat of the pandemic, sharing resources and knowledge more efficiently and effective than ever before, a process broadly described as `open scholarship' (Dunleavy, 2020). This is essentially akin to how free and open source software (FOSS) communities have been operating now for decades (Willinsky, 2005). Recently, we participated in a ``massively open online paper'', or MOOP, that explored the intersections between FOSS and open scholarship (Tennant, Agarwal, et al., 2020). Here, we want to summarise our key findings from that project, and place them in the context of the current outbreak. Critically, this pandemic shows us that many of the pervasive and systemic issues surrounding the evaluation, valuation, use and operationalisation of ``openness'' in scholarship can be extremely easily bypassed when the social demand and urgency is there, thus showing that the primary barriers towards open scholarship are inherently political and not technical.},

The multivariate analysis is conducted with an objective to help the researcher for an in-depth explanatory analysis with a required statistical efficiency. A researcher is interested in investigating the constructs emerging out of sets of variables and the relationships among these constructs. This can be explained with an example such as a sales manager might be interested to investigate a phenomenon that behaviour and discipline of salesperson has a direct influence on sales volume. SEM enables the researcher to indulge into a deeper inquiry through a process of scientific hypothesis testing and extend the present body of knowledge by discovering complex relationships among constructs.

Peer collaboration of this kind, which involves social interaction, reflection and a critical engagement with practice issues, has been widely suggested to be effective for teacher learning and professional development. The online continuing professional development for teachers (e-CPDelT) Vision 2020 model outlined here aims to bring about innovation in practice through an online or virtual CoP (VCoP). Twenty Malaysian teachers in five Smart Schools were invited to take part in a Higher Education (HE) project, funded by one of the main universities in Malaysia. By participating collaboratively in this CoP, it was anticipated that the teachers would form an active online CoP that would lead in turn to innovation in teaching and learning practices in the schools. An action research approach was used in tracing the developmental process of the three subject-based CoPs (namely, Mathematics, Science and English) and identifying challenges faced by the higher education institution (HEI) project team in fostering the active participation and commitment of the teachers. Preliminary data generated from mentor forum discussion, focus groups and blogs suggested that low levels of participation in VCoP activities were a result of low levels of trust and social affiliation, performance anxiety, time pressure and failure to see the relevance of online interaction as directly related to their individual needs as practitioners. Approaches to remediating these challenges and promoting more authentic teacher engagement are outlined. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)},

  abstract = {The global COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent vaccine rollout created unprecedented challenges in the online information environment. Authority figures and institutions, operating with incomplete facts and emerging consensus, struggled to communicate with the public and to assess the mis- and disinformation narratives that required response. The public, looking for accurate health information, confronted a glut of claims; the narratives with the largest reach or highest engagement were not necessarily the most reliable. Rumors, misinformation, and disinformation spread rapidly. Social media companies sought to surface accurate information about the pandemic and vaccines, but faced a challenge: What should they curate or amplify in the absence of clear scientific consensus? How should they identify, and moderate, false and misleading claims? It was against this backdrop that the Virality Project was formed. Drawing on scholarship documenting the who, what, and how of the anti-vaccine movement, the Virality Project identified four categories of well-established narratives likely to emerge as key themes in the COVID-19 vaccine rollout: (1) safety, (2) efficacy and necessity, (3) development and distribution, and (4) conspiracy theory. This report details the narratives, actors, and tactics that shaped COVID-19 vaccine conversations within those themes from February to August 2021. In addition, it assesses the interplay between this content and social media platform policies, surfacing the recurring narratives that attempt to question the safety of vaccines and discourage vaccine uptake. Finally, drawing on these observations, the Virality Project team offers policy recommendations for academics, public health experts, government entities, and tech platforms with the goal of engendering a whole-of-society effort to address health misinformation.},

To research this phenomenon, a convergent, parallel mixed-methods design was used to gather data from an online program in order to explore the learning conditions and context of ePortfolio usage over multiple years. Results indicated that real-world projects and authentic artifacts, the ePortfolio used as a career tool, and management of the ePortfolio were common factors identified in studies that contributed to continued use of the ePortfolio. Findings also revealed that learner autonomy, control, and agency, as well as continued opportunities for choice and voice, led to increased appreciation and ownership of the ePortfolio beyond the program of study.},

Accordingly, the appropriate communication of assessment aims is a priority for all higher education institutions. This study proposes an analytical framework for the interpretation and creation of assessments across higher education disciplines. The framework suggests that assessments can be categorised according to rhetorical purposes, formats, modes and group arrangements. Assessments from three degree programmes at one Australian university are analysed using the framework to show its usefulness in classifying and evaluating task components and generating broad images of degrees based on assessment regimes. We draw on these practical applications to explain and compare discipline-specific qualities of each degree, and argue that the framework might enhance the communication of assessment aims to benefit higher education stakeholders.},

This paper explores the experiences and perceptions of 15 teaching academics from five universities in Victoria, Australia during this time. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with academics after they had been delivering teaching, learning and assessment remotely for a six-month period. The analysis showed that while the remote delivery environment enhanced many aspects of teaching and learning, including agile and adaptable academic skill-sets, there were challenges. The academics' sophisticated teaching skills and experience, that were intuitively relied upon in the face-to-face setting, did not always translate to the online environment. In particular, this was noticed in terms of the relational approach to teaching and learning, including relationships, rapport, and connectedness within classes, and the absence of social formative assessment cues to evaluate learners' understandings. Students were not asking questions in class and required additional support from academics, which subsequently increased already overburdened workloads. After considering the findings of our work and others, we provide recommendations to support high quality teaching and learning in digitally supported remote delivery.},

  abstract = {The assessment of learning in large online courses requires tools that are valid, reliable, easy to administer, and can be automatically scored. We have evaluated an online assessment and learning tool called Knowledge Assembly, or Knowla. Knowla measures a student's knowledge in a particular subject by having the student assemble a set of arbitrarily sized scrambled fragments into a logical order using a web-based interface. Instructors can use Knowla to create assessments and grading criteria. Initial testing of the tool indicates that the measure is reliable and that students access critical thinking skills as they engage with the material. Additionally, testing demonstrates that Knowla can be used to assess learning gains in a subject area. Knowla also shows promise as a learning tool and has already been integrated into university courses.},

  abstract = {This paper attempts to address the possibility of real change after a hundred years of exam-based assessments that produce a single mark or grade as feedback on students' progress and abilities. It uses design thinking and a reframing of the assessment space to foreground an attribute-based approach that retains the diversity of aspects of a student's performance across subject boundaries. There are a number of rationales and concepts built into this approach that aim to divert staff and student focus from marks, content delivery, and retention, towards the development of knowledge literacies, conceptual frameworks, and a broad range of personal qualities and skills. Web-based software (REVIEW) developed and refined for more than a decade to facilitate this approach retains categorised student progress data through the day-to-day criterion-referenced marking of assignments and exams. Education research cited proposes that institutions should engage students as a partner in their personal and professional development rather than as a customer buying a degree. It is suggested and illustrated in this paper that the use of self-assessment and visual feedback on different categories of progress is part of the key to forming such a partnership.},

This article delves into how tertiary English teachers in Thailand practice their agency in response to the abrupt conversion to online teaching amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This study drew on teachers' responses to a questionnaire (n=162) and semi-structure interviews (n=3) to identify their positioning and agentic actions. The results suggest that teachers' positioning as being professionally responsible for students' learning outcomes remains intact, even though the situation restricted them from going beyond their fundamental responsibilities. From a pedagogical standpoint, teachers' agentic actions identified were endeavoring to create an interactive learning environment; implementing social media platforms to compensate for the loss of face-to-face communication; working with students to adjust their teaching practices; promoting autonomous learning; and incorporating formative assessment approaches. Teachers might find themselves struggling to achieve their pedagogical goals, but once they become familiar with the new learning environment and master suitable teaching methods, online learning can be a viable option for formal language education, even in the normal situation.},

  abstract = {Whilst it is frequently argued that assessment sits at the heart of the learning process, in practice assessment often remains narrowly focused on qualifications and reporting achievements, driven by institutional and societal aspirations and tensions such as accountability and economic well being. Yet, the need for assessment to account for the knowledge, skills, dispositions and attitudes necessary to equip young people for a changing and increasingly digital world is also increasingly acknowledged. Based on our recent research review, this article critically examines the role of technology enhanced assessment (or TEA). We argue that whilst technology offers many potentially creative opportunities for innovation and for rethinking assessment purposes, there are also numerous risks and challenges. In particular we highlight ethical concerns over social exclusion and new forms of digital dividedness and the increasing risks associated with big data and the rise of learning analytics. Finally, we note that much research and innovation happens in silos, where policy, research and practice on assessment, technology enhanced assessment and ethical and political concerns are not linked up. We conclude that there needs to be a much more wide-ranging, critical and nuanced discussion in educational and policy circles so that debates about the potential of technology can be linked to improving assessment in the light of the range of social and political challenges that such progress presents. We end with some critical questions for policy, practice and research communities which we offer as a starting point for future thinking and ways forward.},

One recent phenomenon is ChatGPT, a chatbot with a conversational artificial intelligence interface that was developed by OpenAI. As one of the most advanced artificial intelligence applications, ChatGPT has drawn much public attention across the globe. In this regard, this study examines ChatGPT in education, among early adopters, through a qualitative instrumental case study. Conducted in three stages, the first stage of the study reveals that the public discourse in social media is generally positive and there is enthusiasm regarding its use in educational settings. However, there are also voices who are approaching cautiously using ChatGPT in educational settings. The second stage of the study examines the case of ChatGPT through lenses of educational transformation, response quality, usefulness, personality and emotion, and ethics. In the third and final stage of the study, the investigation of user experiences through ten educational scenarios revealed various issues, including cheating, honesty and truthfulness of ChatGPT, privacy misleading, and manipulation. The findings of this study provide several research directions that should be considered to ensure a safe and responsible adoption of chatbots, specifically ChatGPT, in education.},

  abstract = {For example, Hanusch (2013) published a study titled "Charting a Theoretical Framework for Examining Indigenous Journalism Culture." The singular form of the noun "journalism" in the title obliterates the multiple and diverse philosophies and practices embodied by Indigenous media workers in countries worldwide. Despite these vast differences, Hanusch reduces Indigenous journalisms to the following shared dimensions: dedication to community service, language preservation, attachment to culture and tradition, and counter-narrative to mainstream media. Based on these characteristics, Indigenous journalisms are presented in essentialist terms as always interventionist and always culturally specific. Hanusch refers to Indigenous media and journalisms as political projects whose "core reason for existence" is "speaking back," "providing a sense of empowerment," and being a "counter-narrative" (p. 86) to mainstream media and its misrepresentations of Indigenous peoples. The underlying notion behind these essentializing characterizations is that of two separate public spheres : Indigenous and non-Indigenous, with Indigenous journalism catering only to the former. Moreover, these characterizations are tied to the dichotomies of active/neutral, objectivist/interventionist, and truth/subjectivity mentioned above. Indigenous journalism can only be considered cultural and activist when compared with the universal, neutral, and professional journalism attributed to Western cultures and liberal democracies. The act of comparison thus constitutes a process of relational self-definition of Western Self against Indigenous Other. As mentioned above, the special topic course Reporting in Indigenous Communities created by [Duncan McCue] at the University of British Columbia in Canada was inspired by similar programs in Australia. McCue explains in an interview that the course addresses two issues: 1) under-representation of Indigenous peoples in the media, and 2) stereotypes such as "Native as victim," "Native as warrior," and more recently, "Native as incompetent manager" ([McKeon], 2011, para. 5). To counter these stereotypes, McCue designed the course as a graduate, full-term, "intense study of aboriginal people in the media" and "a lot of working hands-on with aboriginal people" (paras. 2-3) on topical issues such as health, education, Indigenous youth, and water. The course also addresses the "discomfort" of non-Indigenous reporters and their concerns about how to "ask tough questions of chiefs" without "being seen as racist or having a bias" (para. 11). The empowering effects of the course on non-Indigenous students are illustrated by comments from two non-Indigenous female students, who referred to gaining the trust of Indigenous spiritual dancers and being able to access sacred locations of the St{\'o}:lo communities in the Fraser Valley (Bergen \& Kelly, 2013). The students used tactics such as transparency and perseverance to report on this "very secretive spiritual tradition" (introduction and para. 1) and presented the story on CBC Radio, thus launching their professional careers.},

Students and professors of higher education institutions who had not yet experienced distance learning before COVID-19 pandemic period participated in the study. The participants belong to the universities located in Mediterranean basin, e.g., Albania, Italy, Morocco, Algeria and few African countries. Results suggest that distance learning will shift many of the responsibilities formerly on the professors to those of the students. The data suggests the need for emotional support during this transition, specifically to maintain interaction among students and professor as well as among students themselves in distance learning platforms as in traditional classrooms. The study shows that the effectiveness and the interactivity of this new paradigm are very important and any further developments of distance learning should provide strong support for these components. The position of the professor is indispensable as the guide to the entire process, suggesting that at least at the time of this writing (2020) distance learning approach is perceived only to be an intermittent complementary path to in-person interactions.},

This book draws not only on critical qualitative inquiry methods such as interview and observation, but also on theories and sensibilities from creative writing and performance studies, which encourage self-reflection and narrative composition. Concepts from qualitative inquiry studies, which examine everyday life, are combined with approaches to the creation of character and scene to help writers develop engaging narratives that examine chosen subcultures and the author's position in relation to her research subjects. The book brings together a brief history of first-person qualitative research and writing from the past forty years, examining the evolution of nonfiction and qualitative approaches in relation to the personal essay. A selection of recent student writing in the genre as well as reflective student essays on the experience of conducting research in the classroom is presented in the context of exercises for coursework and beyond. Also explored in detail are guidelines for interviewing and identifying subjects and techniques for creating informed sketches and images that engage the reader. This book provides approaches anyone can use to explore their communities and write about them first-hand. The methods presented can be used for a single assignment in a larger course or to guide an entire semester through many levels and varieties of informed personal writing."--Open Textbook Library.},

Digital PA is of increasing relevance as more educational establishments are moving toward online or blended learning. It has been widely used for some time, not only in elementary (primary) and high (secondary) schools but also in higher education. In this article, the purposes of PA are considered. Then, questions of effectiveness are briefly discussed. Then, the majority of the article describes in general terms how to do it. A review is offered for variations in types of PA and the underpinning theory, both of which have practical implications, irrespective of whether the PA is digital or face-to-face. Then, the use of different kinds of digital hardware in different kinds of PA will be considered. After this, the social and emotional aspects of digital PA are considered. As the contexts are so different, differences between primary school, high school, and higher education are reviewed. A conclusion summarises the strengths and weaknesses of digital PA, which can certainly be effective as a teaching and learning method and enhance student communication, problem-solving, and self-confidence.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Higher education is increasingly called upon to respond to the need for educational innovations promoting graduate employability and lifelong learning (European Higher Education Area, 2012, 2015). To achieve this, students must progressively become able to reflect both on their learning and their potential to improve and plan their own educational and professional development accordingly (D'Andrea \& Gosling, 2005). The portfolio, now used in many university courses worldwide, is a tool that contributes to responding to these needs. A study of literature on this subject indicates that the portfolio's effectiveness during the teaching-learning and assessment processes is dependent on the ability of teachers to master this tool. It follows that, in order to facilitate the effective implementation and use of the portfolio in universities, teachers need to receive suitable training. This paper presents the characteristics and results of a training course on the use of the portfolio. The course was part of an extensive training project for university teachers in the University of Turin's IRIDI program that was aimed at promoting the improvement and innovation of university teaching. The results of the training course show a higher level of competency in creating a portfolio, and a higher level of willingness to introduce it into teaching.},

The survey method was employed when collecting the study data, and the data-collection instrument used was the E-Learning Readiness Scale. The scale comprises 33 items and six sub-dimensions, including (1) computer self-efficacy, (2) internet self-efficacy, (3) online self-efficacy, (4) self-directed learning, (5) learner control, (6) motivation toward e-learning. The study participants comprised 153 freshmen who were taking an online English as a Foreign Language course. A relational model is proposed in this study to measure the predicted levels of readiness on academic achievement in online learning. Reliability analysis, Pearson correlation, linear regression analysis, and structural equation modelling were used to analyze and model the study data. Results indicated that self-directed learning is the strongest predictor of academic achievement, while motivation toward e-learning was found to be another predictor of academic achievement. Internet/online/computer self-efficacy and learner control were not found to be among significant predictors of academic achievement. It is concluded that, especially with the spread of Covid-19 worldwide, education is currently switching from face-to-face to online learning in an immediate and unexpected way; therefore e-learning readiness has to be carefully taken into consideration within this new educational paradigm.},

The results of this analysis indicate the breadth of VR-based applications in training users on a combination of topics including risk assessment, machinery, and/or process operation in various industries. Data showed that the use of fully immersive VR increased significantly due to the improvements in hardware, display resolution, and affordability. Most of the articles used external assessment to measure the changes in the satisfaction and the declarative knowledge of trainees as these are easier to implement, while some articles started to implement internal assessment that provides an automated assessment capable of measuring complex skills. The results of the study also suggest that it has the potential to improve the training evaluation outcomes compared to traditional training methods. The findings from this study help practitioners and safety managers by providing a training design framework that may be adopted to optimise the condition of a VR-based training.},

  abstract = {It is common to create courses for the higher education context that accomplish contentdriven teaching goals and then develop assessments (quizzes and exams) based on the target content. However, content-driven assessment can tend to support teaching- or teacher-centered instruction. Adult learning and educational psychology theories suggest that instead, assessment should be aligned with learning, not teaching, objectives. To support the alignment of assessments with instruction in higher education, the Assessment Evaluation Rubric (AER) was developed. The AER can be utilized to guide the development and evaluation/revision of assessments that are already used. The AER describes, or permits the evaluation of, four features of an assessment: its general alignment with learning goal(s), whether the assessment is intended to/effective as formative or summative, whether some systematic approach to cognitive complexity is reflected, and whether the assessment (instructions as well as results) itself is clearly interpretable. Each dimension (alignment, utility, complexity, and clarity) has four questions that can be rated as present/absent. Other rating methods can also be conceptualized for the AER's 16 questions, depending on the user's intent. Any instructor can use the AER to evaluate their own assessments and ensure that they-or new assessments in development-will promote learning and learner-centered teaching. As instructors shift from face-to-face toward virtual or hybrid teaching models, or as they shift online instruction (back) to face-to-face teaching, it creates an ideal opportunity to ensure that assessment is optimizing learning and is valid for instructional decision-making.},

The results of the research demonstrate that in the institution under research, these criteria are not present in most cases of DB descriptions as teachers do not provide them. Distinct assessment and recognition criteria make an important quality factor for the DBs to become valid and valued digital credentials in HE.},

The results support previous research in identifying relationships between perceptions/evaluations of the learning environment and approach to study and between approach to study and the quality of the learning outcomes. The second of the two studies reported also identifies a relationship between perceptions, approaches and the quality of the outcomes.

However, the current approach to learning analytics presents tensions between increasing student agency in making learning-related decisions and 'datafying' students in the process of collecting, analysing and interpreting data. This article presents a study that explores staff and student experience of agency, equity and transparency in existing data practices and expectations towards learning analytics in a UK university. The results show a number of intertwined factors that have contributed to the tensions between enhancing a learner's control of their studies and, at the same time, diminishing their autonomy as an active agent in the process of learning analytics. This article argues that learner empowerment should not be automatically assumed to have taken place as part of the adoption of learning analytics. Instead, the interwoven power relationships in a complex educational system and the interactions between humans and machines need to be taken into consideration when presenting learning analytics as an equitable process to enhance student agency and educational equity.},

The unique approach in this study is that students are expected to send their selfie-recorded self- or group assessments via mobile phones or cameras enabling self-recording to their teachers through the Internet.

The perceived increased use of continuous assessment periodically captures media attention, with claims of greater numbers of higher degree classifications being awarded. This paper takes a case-study approach to investigate the extent to which different types of assessment allow students to effectively demonstrate and apply their learning. By considering data gathered from second-level, undergraduate students completing 60 point, online psychology modules, this paper investigates assessment effectiveness in terms of student satisfaction, pass rate and level of pass rate. Findings reveal that modules with an end of module assessment (EMA), rather than an examination, have higher completion and pass rates. Whilst students who took a seen examination also performed well, those who completed an unseen examination recorded the lowest overall pass and completion rates, despite high ratings of student satisfaction. Findings are discussed in terms of implications for improved pedagogy and student experience.},

  abstract = {Research comparing continuous assessment (e.g. coursework) with examinations generally reveals a student preference for the former. The perceived increased use of continuous assessment periodically captures media attention, with claims of greater numbers of higher degree classifications being awarded. This paper takes a case-study approach to investigate the extent to which different types of assessment allow students to effectively demonstrate and apply their learning. By considering data gathered from second-level, undergraduate students completing 60 point, online psychology modules, this paper investigates assessment effectiveness in terms of student satisfaction, pass rate and level of pass rate. Findings reveal that modules with an end of module assessment (EMA), rather than an examination, have higher completion and pass rates. Whilst students who took a seen examination also performed well, those who completed an unseen examination recorded the lowest overall pass and completion rates, despite high ratings of student satisfaction. Findings are discussed in terms of implications for improved pedagogy and student experience.},

Existing validated digital competence scales usually ignore either important digital skills needed or new socio-technological innovations. This study proposes and validates a comprehensive digital competence scale for students in higher education. The suggested instrument includes skills of online learning and collaboration, social media, smart and mobile devices, safety, and data protection. The scale was evaluated on a sample of 156 undergraduate and postgraduate students just before and at the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. The final scale is composed of 28 items and six digital competence components. The evaluation study revealed valid results in terms of model fit criteria, factor loadings, internal validity, and reliability. Individual factors like the students' field of study, computer experience and age revealed significant associations to the scale components, while gender revealed no significant differences. The suggested scale can be useful to the design of new actions and policies towards remote education and the digital skills' development of adult learners.},

  abstract = {Immersive learning technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and educational digital games offer many benefits to teaching and learning. With their potential to immerse learners in realistic environments and facilitate higher-order cognitive learning, these technologies could be used to complement current classroom pedagogical practices. However, given that these learning environments differ from conventional classroom learning activities, current assessment practices may be insufficient for assessing learning in immersive environments. This paper develops the concept of a game-based assessment framework (GBAF) for educators interested in the assessment of learning in digital games, VR or AR. Importantly, this paper also presents the application of the framework to the design and implementation of assessments for a VR game during the game design phase. Grounded in the principles of Constructive Alignment and the Evidence-Centred Design (ECD) framework, this assessment framework describes the steps to consider for assessments and outlines the components that must be aligned for the design of assessments. To illustrate the application of the GBAF to the design of assessments for immersive learning environments, a stepwise design of assessments for a VR game is presented. The results of the outcome of the assessment of laboratory health and safety competencies of six engineering students is also presented. The GBAF offers simple and useful guidelines for the design of assessments around game tasks. It could serve as a structured basis for educators and researchers to design assessments to measure lower and higher-order cognitive learning in complex immersive environments.},

While the expert designers used the tool, they used it as a word processor with a rich database of instructional strategies. The novice designers relied on the tool for advice, guidance, and assistance in completing all the design tasks. Non-designers used the tool for learning about design. The novice designer is likely to gain more benefit from using the tool than a naI{\textlnot}{\AE}ve or expert designer. Novice designers can use the tool to reinforce their prior knowledge as well as filling in any gaps in the knowledge of the design process. Based on this study, we might expect the use of an automated tool to diminish as the designer gains experience. Non-designers should probably be trained on instructional design tasks prior to exposure to automated instructional design tools.},

However, most lecturers in Nigerian universities still adopt the traditional method of instruction not minding the demands of the twenty-first century classrooms. As a result of this, there is a dearth of empirical evidence on the impact of computer-assisted instruction on the students' achievement in physics. This study, therefore, sought the efficacy of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) on students' achievement in physics. A randomized controlled trial experimental design was adopted for the study using a sample of 120 participants. Physics Achievement Test (PAT) was used to collect data for the study. Analysis of covariance was used to analyze the data. It was found that Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI) had a significant effect on students' achievement in physics at posttest and follow-up assessments. Thus, Physics education lecturers should be trained on how to design and use CAI package for effective twenty-first century classroom instructional delivery in a Nigerian university.},

Devising a teaching workload equation that includes all teaching and learning strategies in the 21st century higher education learning setting is needed. This is indeed a challenging task for the academic administrators to scrutinize every single parameter that accounted for teaching and learning. In this work, we have discussed the parameters which are significant in teaching workload calculation. For instance, the conventional in-person contact with the students, type of delivery, type of assessment, the preparation of materials for flipped classroom as well as MOOC, to name a few. Teaching workload also affects quality teaching and from the academic perception, the higher workload means lower-quality teaching.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p class="3"{$>$}Digital curation may be regarded as a core competency in higher education since it contributes to establishing a sense of metaliteracy (an essential requirement for optimally functioning in a modern media environment) among students. Digital curation is gradually finding its way into higher education curricula aimed at fostering social media literacies. Teachers are urged to blend informal and formal learning and since most people informally use curation in their daily lives for compiling relevant information, it may be fairly easy to adopt digital curation in teaching and learning. Teachers, however, require considerable insight in incorporating various informal digital curation tools in educational practices. ~The SECTIONS model may assist in guiding decisions around the suitability of digital curation tools for a higher education environment. Including digital literacy training in the professional development of academic staff members may sensitize them to the possibilities that incorporating digital approaches in curricula offer. The Five Cs of Digital Curation framework may guide academic staff members in compiling suitable digital material. There as yet appears not to be a pedagogy that fully acknowledges the various digital curation processes. A pedagogy of abundance, acknowledging that content often is freely available and abundant, may eventually prove relevant in this regard.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is a technology acceptance model formulated by Venkatesh and others in "User acceptance of information technology: Toward a unified view". The UTAUT aims to explain user intentions to use an information system and subsequent usage behavior. The theory holds that there are four key constructs:  1) performance expectancy,  2) effort expectancy,  3) social influence, and  4) facilitating conditions. The first three are direct determinants of usage intention and behavior, and the fourth is a direct determinant of user behavior. Gender, age, experience, and voluntariness of use are posited to moderate the impact of the four key constructs on usage intention and behavior. The theory was developed through a review and consolidation of the constructs of eight models that earlier research had employed to explain information systems usage behaviour (theory of reasoned action, technology acceptance model, motivational model, theory of planned behavior, a combined theory of planned behavior/technology acceptance model, model of personal computer use, diffusion of innovations theory, and social cognitive theory). Subsequent validation by Venkatesh et al. (2003) of UTAUT in a longitudinal study found it to account for 70\% of the variance in Behavioural Intention to Use (BI) and about 50\% in actual use.},

After a brief distraction and without the opportunity to study, they took a quiz. As in the original study, laptop participants took notes containing more words spoken verbatim by the lecturer and more words overall than did longhand participants. However, laptop participants did not perform better than longhand participants on the quiz. Exploratory meta-analyses of eight similar studies echoed this pattern. In addition, in both the original study and our replication, higher word count was associated with better quiz performance, and higher verbatim overlap was associated with worse quiz performance, but the latter finding was not robust in our replication. Overall, results do not support the idea that longhand note taking improves immediate learning via better encoding of information.},

Various DNN-AES models with different characteristics have been proposed over the past few years. To our knowledge, however, no study has provided a comprehensive review of DNN-AES models while introducing each model in detail. Therefore, this review presents a comprehensive survey of DNN-AES models, describing the main idea and detailed architecture of each model. We classify the AES task into four types and introduce existing DNN-AES models according to this classification.},

In addition to teaching domain-specific knowledge and skills, the role of higher education should be reorganizing current teaching and studying practices in a way that allows students to take control over their projects and environments. Contemporary models of instructional design consider a learning environment as a predefined element in instruction created and controlled by an educational authority. On the other hand an emerging personal learning environment (PLE) discourse emphasizes learner control over an environment. However, current interpretations of PLEs leave other instructional functions unattended. The article proposes an elaborated understanding of PLE, one which integrates important instructional functions of learner control. The theoretical framework presented in this article is inspired by conceptual ideas developed within the iCamp ( www.icamp.eu) project. The article illustrates the line of argumentation with students experiences gathered from a pilot course taught at Tallinn University, Estonia.

  abstract = {Formative assessment including feedback to students on their learning is widely recognized as an effective means to support student learning. Research has found that the potential of formative assessment in improving student learning is often not fully realized in classroom practice. IT provides a possible solution for overcoming some of the obstacles when implementing formative assessment. This chapter reviews various ways in which IT has been used in formative assessment, focusing specifically on digital learning environments, game-based assessment, classroom response systems, Web 2.0, and video feedback. The results suggest that using IT as a platform for feedback provides opportunity to individualize feedback, increase student engagement, collect learning evidence for all students, facilitate reflective processes, and support self-regulated learning. Reported potential challenges to the utilization of IT include time restrictions, limited response formats, technical difficulties, access to evidence of student learning for teachers, and teacher knowledge and skills. One key finding is that although innovations in technology have evolved considerably, many promising possibilities are not yet being exploited for the purpose of formative assessment. Most importantly, research demonstrates that not the technologies themselves, but the ways in which they are used impact on their formative potential. Bringing together IT and formative assessment may open up the potential for moving from convergent forms of feedback to more open, divergent feedback practices.},

Moreover, research on the design of ideal feedback as well as its effects is rare. In order to contribute to the development of this field, a web-based feedback system was implemented in a lecture at the University of Cologne. The effects of this feedback on the students' learning process are presented in this article. Differences in the students' learning success and motivation, as well as their assessment of competencies, are analyzed within an experimental setting. Students who received individual feedback through this system achieved higher grades and showed increased levels of motivation. Moreover, they felt more competent with regard to solving tasks related to the learning material.},

  abstract = {Metacognition is a required cognitive ability to achieve deep and meaningful learning that should be viewed from both an individual and social perspective. Recently, the transition from the earliest individualistic models to an acknowledgement of metacognition as socially situated and socially constructed has precipitated the study of metacognition in collaborative learning environments. This metacognitive construct was developed using the Community of Inquiry framework as a theoretical guide and tested applying qualitative research techniques by way of developing a metacognition questionnaire. The results indicate that in order to better understand the structure and dynamics of metacognition in teacher education programs; we must go beyond individual approaches to learning and consider metacognition in terms of complementary self- and co-regulation that integrates individual and shared regulation. This research study examines this shared metacognition framework and the use of digital technologies in the 3rd year of a Canadian Bachelor of Education program. Teacher candidates completed both the Shared Metacognition and Community of Inquiry surveys. The results indicate that a teacher must use digital technologies to intentionally design, facilitate, and direct a collaborative constructive learning environment in order for students to learn how to co-regulate their learning (shared metacognition).Alternate abstract:R{\'e}sum{\'e}: La m{\'e}tacognition est une capacit{\'e} cognitive requise pour r{\'e}aliser un apprentissage profond et significatif qui doit {\^e}tre consid{\'e}r{\'e} {\`a} la fois d'un point de vue individuel et social.

  abstract = {This article explores the benefits and challenges of blended learning in higher education from the perspective of students, faculty, and administration that have had direct experience with this form of course delivery. Students indicate that a blended learning model provides them with greater time flexibility and improved learning outcomes but that initially they encounter issues around time management, taking greater responsibility for their own learning, and using sophisticated technologies. Faculty suggest that blended courses create enhanced opportunities for teacher-student interaction, increased student engagement in learning, added flexibility in the teaching and learning environment, and opportunities for continuous improvement. They state that the challenges faced in developing such a course include a lack of time, support and resources for course redesign, acquiring new teaching and technology skills, plus the risks associated with delivering a course in a blended format. From an administrative perspective, blended learning presents the opportunity to enhance an institution's reputation, expand access to an institution's educational offerings, and reduce operating costs. The challenges consist of aligning blended learning with institutional goals and priorities, resistance to organizational change and lack of organizational structure and experience with collaboration and partnerships.

The powerful technologies that facilitate the online learning environment also provide tools to undermine the quality of assessments. While these discussions have typically focused on word-based searches using well-known search engines, very little comment has revolved around the use of image-based searches. Here, through a small sample of illustrative examples, the potential impact of image-based search technology on online chemistry assessments is discussed.},

Well-designed digital grading is more reliable and faster than hand grading and is scalable to larger classes. The validity of digital grading is open to criticism, particularly in mathematics where much of mathematics is based on processes and reasoning and not on the final answer achieved. At a technical university in the Netherlands, we have been increasing our use of digital short answer testing in calculus and linear algebra for service mathematics. To assess the validity of this mode of assessment, we graded a linear algebra test in two ways: short answer grading (where answers were considered either correct or incorrect) and the so-called 'hypothetical grading', where we assigned a grade based on the fully worked solution. Certain types of items proved to be more suitable for short answer (and hence digital) testing than others. We concluded our analysis with a set of design principles for digital or short answer testing in linear algebra.},

  abstract = {[Information technology (IT) acceptance research has yielded many competing models, each with different sets of acceptance determinants. In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.]},

This article investigates the potential for a web-based e-portfolio tool to support and streamline social work field education and assessment processes. Social work students, field educators, and university-appointed liaison staff (N = 110) from a large Australian university completed an online survey administered at the end of placement. The majority of participants reported that the e-portfolio provided a useful framework for recording evidence of student learning; was simple to use; saved time; and had the capacity to enhance the quality and immediacy of communication between parties. We argue that e-portfolios can efficiently capture evidence of student learning and provide a robust mode of supporting social work students on placement.

  abstract = {This article provides a brief history of K--12 education testing in the United States from colonial America to the present. In early America, students were examined orally. After the mid-nineteenth century, written tests replaced oral presentations. In the late nineteenth century, graded schools gradually replaced the single-teacher, one-room schools. In the beginning of the twentieth century, standardized intelligence tests were increasingly used to categorize and promote students. State departments of education have played a larger role in local school funding and policies in the past hundred years. Since the 1960s, the federal government has expanded its involvement in national education while also promoting the role of states. During the past three decades, the federal government and states increased the use of high-stakes national testing with initiatives such as America 2000, Goals 2000, No Child Left Behind, and Every Student Succeeds.},

The first part of the paper gives an overview of the concept and nature of Open Badges through a review of literature, the second describes the use of Open Badges in the Study Area of Information Sciences of the School of Digital Technologies at Tallinn University. The course used four types of open badges in the assessment process: basic knowledge badges, advanced knowledge badges, skill based badges and level based badges. Open Badges were directly linked to the learning outcomes and formal grading system of the course. Based on recent experience, it can be said that Open Badges are valuable tools in the assessment process which will give a more holistic picture of educational achievement of the learner. Multiple learning pathways within the course provided learners opportunities to choose their personal learning path according to their personal learning goals, learning style, interests and other preferences. Open Badges also allowed to recognize 'soft skills' or literacies. Open Badges could be also a useful tool to assess students' information literacies in different contexts.},

To achieve this aim, innovative teaching methods are often deployed, including games and simulations, which form the subject of this paper. As the field of digital games and simulations is ever maturing, this paper attempts to systematically review the literature relevant to games and simulation pedagogy in higher education. Two researchers collaborate to apply a qualitative method, coding and synthesizing the results using multiple criteria. The main objective is to study the impact of games and simulations with regard to achieving specific learning objectives. On balance, results indicate that games and/or simulations have a positive impact on learning goals. The researchers identify three learning outcomes when integrating games into the learning process: cognitive, behavioural, and affective. As a final step, the authors consolidate evidence for the benefit of academics and practitioners in higher education interested in the efficient use of games and simulations for pedagogical purposes. Such evidence also provides potential options and pathways for future research.},

The chapter describes the two main approaches for conducting factor analysis (and how to combine them in an integrated factor analysis strategy) and provides a tutorial on implementing both techniques in the R programming language. The first is confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), a more theory-driven approach, in which a researcher actively specifies the number of underlying constructs as well as the pattern of relations between these dimensions and observed variables. The second is exploratory factor analysis (EFA), a more data-driven approach, in which the number of underlying constructs is inferred from the data, and all underlying constructs are assumed to influence all observed variables (at least to some degree).},

  abstract = {Digital and network society learning happens in new, timeless and borderless spaces. Such society members are always connected and online, sharing and co-creating knowledge, and their learning needs serve as the biggest driving forces for higher education curriculum change. Open online learning methodology seems to be the best-suited way to implement this change, in order to meet the needs of digital and network society. This research aims to investigate why and when open online learning is relevant for digital and network society and how open online learning supports curriculum change in higher education to meet the learning needs of digital and network society members. Theoretical research findings are discussed to: a) define the characteristics of digital and networked society, b) identify emerging ways of learning of a digital and networked society, and explain why open online learning is best suited for their needs, c) discuss the gap between the new ways of learning and higher education curricula and how open online learning is relevant for its change. Empirical research is based on global experts' semi-structured interviews. The results of the research demonstrate that open online learning should serve as a solution for curriculum change in higher education to respond to digital and network society learning needs. Higher education curricula should change to ensure better flexibility, recognition of nonformal learning in formal curricula, better collaboration and exchange of people with diverse cultural and social experiences. Assessment and recognition of prior learning in the formal curricula of universities could be one of realistic scenarios for faster adaptation and introduction of more diversified learning paths. The research findings support the need to change the pedagogical approach from teacher-centred into a learner-centred, small-group orientated, multidimensional model of teaching, which raise further challenges and research dilemmas for academic community, in order to integrate important elements of change into university practices.},

The aim of this study is to determine the frequency of student incivility in higher education and coping techniques employed by academics. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected together with a measurement tool developed by the researchers. The method of the research is a mixed method and qualitative and quantitative data were collected at the same time. A total of 250 academics working at universities in Turkey have voluntarily participated in the study. During the analysis process, construct validity concerning the quantitative data obtained from the data collection tool has been established through DFA, and parametric test statistics have been applied for data analysis. The results obtained from the study have indicated that not studying, playing with the cell phone, and not listening to the lecture are among the most frequent students' uncivil behaviors the academic witness. A significant difference has been identified between the two independent variables of the research --"seniority \& working period at the current university"-- and student incivility. The academics think that as seniority and working period at the same workplace increase, students show less of uncivil behaviors. "Verbal warning" has been noted as the most frequent method used by academics to deal with these kinds of behaviors. The implications of these findings for intervention design and development and further research are discussed.},

In response, we critique this trend toward reductionist, comparative, and ostensibly objective assessments in the United States. We describe how management has replaced democratic selfgovernance in higher education, and connect current managerial leadership with the use of assessment as a tool in furthering market based educational aims. Lastly, we provide an alternative view of assessment as an ethical, value concerned social practice that creates space for dialogue about how higher education contributes to learning toward the public good.},

From five consecutive annual cohorts (2007-2011), 220 university students completed questionnaires about their attitudes and experience of using e-portfolio assessment in an English as a foreign language course, with 120 students participating in follow-up interviews and focus groups. The vast majority of learners expressed preference for e-portfolio assessment, compared to paper-based examinations. This study contributes to understanding Chinese educational ideology of assessment, so as to place emphasis on assessment for quality learning rather than on teaching to the test.},

There is good research evidence to show that well designed assessment systems lead to improved student performance and ensure success of students. Electronic assessment, which is regarded as the flip side of the e-learning coin, is acclaimed by some stakeholders in UAE higher education institutions as a possible magic bullet or saviour for the evaluation of learning. Others argue that e-assessment might herald the death of assessments with high levels of reliability and validity. This qualitative study investigates teachers and students' perceptions of e-assessment within a private higher education institution (HEI) in the UAE. Through the use of a questionnaire and interviews, perceptions of virtual learning environments, e-assessment methods on virtual platforms, and the process of giving feedback on performance on e-assessments are analysed. The participants offered unique insights into the conduct of e-assessment and most were concerned about the prospect of electronic feedback replacing verbal feedback and face-to-face interaction between the lecturers and students. Most participants indicated some benefits of e-assessments to the pedagogical processes in the university, but were reluctant to express wholehearted agreement with a transition to e-assessments as a sole @ method of summative evaluation. The study concludes by recommending ways of promoting the idea of e-assessment to lecturers and students including new codes of practice, training and assurances to both stakeholders that these new methods are an improvement on previous practice and that e-assessment can actually increase reliability and validity.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The neoliberal transformation of higher education in the UK and an intertwined focus on the productive efficiency and prestige value of universities has led to an epidemic of overwork and precarity among academics. Many are found to be struggling with lofty performance expectations and an insistence that all dimensions of their work consistently achieve positional gains despite ferocious competition and the omnipresent threat of failure. Working under the current audit culture present across education, academics are thus found to overwork or commit to accelerated labour as pre-emptive compensation for the habitual inclemency of peer-review and vagaries of student evaluation, in accommodating the copiousness of `invisible' tasks, and in eluding the myriad crevasses of their precarious labour. The proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools and more specifically, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, offers potential relief for academics and a means to offset intensive demands and discover more of a work-based equilibrium. Through a recent survey of               n               \,=\,284 UK academics and their use of GAI, we discover, however, that the digitalisation of higher education through GAI tools no more alleviates than extends the dysfunctions of neoliberal logic and deepens academia's malaise. Notwithstanding, we argue that the proliferating use of GAI tools by academics may be harnessed as a source of positive disruption to the industrialisation of their labour and catalyst of (re)engagement with scholarly craftsmanship.},

Concept maps, which capture the content and structure of knowledge, can be used to assess conceptual knowledge, although cumbersome scoring methods limit their use. A literature review was conducted to summarize concept map scoring methods and automated scoring programs. While quantitative, component-based methods prevailed in the literature, no program was available to automate this method. Thus, the goal of this project was to present and evaluate a component-based computer program for scoring concept maps. The program automates application of the traditional scoring method in which number of concepts, highest hierarchy, and number of cross-links are counted as indicators of knowledge breadth, depth, and connectedness, respectively. A sample of concept maps (n = 78) was scored by two judges and the computer program. High agreement (Krippendorff's alpha {$>$} 0.80) between manual and automated scores was observed for number of concepts and number of cross-links. Although less than acceptable agreement between manual and automated scores was observed for highest hierarchy, the two measures of knowledge depth were highly correlated (Spearman's rho {$>$} 0.5). Ultimately, the computer program's measure of knowledge depth was termed longest path, while judges' measure of knowledge depth was termed longest hierarchy. Overall, the computer program can be used to rapidly, precisely, and reliably score concept maps to aid in assessment of conceptual knowledge.},

We also use the case to examine assessment in higher education more broadly, exploring the tensions between the requirements for certification and the need for learning.

In this paper we examine whether an online simulation-based learning and assessment design, developed using the tools and functionality within the available university online ecosystem, has measurable 'authenticity' in a postgraduate course. In addition, we assess whether the simulation is associated with improvements in student learning behaviours and outcomes. We analyse qualitative data from lecturer and student interviews and student work submitted online, as well as data analytics from the learning management system in both control and experimental conditions. Seven critical elements of authentic assessment were identified including new aspects of authenticity relating to simulation-specific affordances (e.g. emotional content, temporal dimensions and unpredictability). Students watched lecture videos and participated in online discussion more frequently in the online simulation than in the control condition and indicated perceived mastery of, and confidence in, the learning outcomes. These findings make important contributions to authentic assessment theory and have practical implications for simulations built in online ecosystems available in higher education.},

Data from these analyses were processed and used to judge the degree of alignment on four criteria: categorical concurrence, depth-of-knowledge consistency, range-of-knowledge correspondence, and balance of representation. The analyses indicated that the standards of the four states varied in what content students were expected to know, the level of specificity at which expectations were expressed, and organization. Nearly all of the sixteen assessment instruments reviewed incorporated some constructed-response items. Only one mathematics assessment for grade 10 from one state consisted solely of multiple-choice items. The items in three science and two mathematics assessments analyzed from one state were evenly divided between multiple-choice and constructed-response items. Assessments from the other three states included from 80\% to 90\% multiple-choice items. Alignment between assessments and standards varied across grade levels, content areas, and states without any discernable pattern. Assessments and standards of three of the four states satisfied the categorical concurrence criterion. This criterion, the most common conception of alignment, required the assessment and standards to include the same content topics. Alignment was found to be the weakest on the depth-of-knowledge consistency and range-of-knowledge correspondence criteria. Generally, assessment items required a lower level of knowledge and did not span the full spectrum of knowledge as expressed in the standards. However, for the knowledge and skills identified in the standards and addressed by the assessments, generally the assessment items were evenly distributed. A major goal of this study was to develop a valid and reliable process for analyzing the alignment among standards and assessments. The process did produce credible results that distinguished among the different attributes of alignment and detected specific ways that alignment could be improved. Issues that did arise from an analysis of the process indicated that reviewers could benefit from more training at the beginning of the institute. Reviewers also needed more clarification of the four depth-of-knowledge levels and more explicit rules for assigning an assessment item to more than one statement of expectation.

  abstract = {IT-based assessment has been advancing rapidly, and its growth is set to accelerate with emerging opportunities for automatic data collection as well as increased possibilities of communication and interaction mediated by IT. In this chapter we aim to present an overview of the range of different opportunities for IT to support assessment. We identify and discuss challenges for moving toward a situation where IT-based assessment can serve learners' needs as well as the broader needs of the educational system for evaluation. We examine theories related to assessment more generally as well as specifically to IT-enabled assessment and review recent research and development. Scenarios for IT-enabled assessments may take many different forms, some of which hold much promise for supporting learning, but there are theoretical, developmental, technical, and human challenges to be overcome. Our vision is for IT-based assessment design to move forward with designers, teachers, and learners working together to design assessments that support twenty-first-century curricula and pedagogy. In this shared endeavor, we expect that data can be collected and represented to enable learners and teachers to identify achievements; collate evidence of those achievements; diagnose needs, both cognitive and affective; and decide on suitable pedagogical approaches for enabling the next steps in learning. We argue that open assessment resources provide a vehicle for enabling the large-scale developments that are needed to support the development of IT-enabled assessment across the broad spectrum of learning. Some of the more complex twenty-first-century skills of collaboration, problem-solving, critical thinking, etc. present particular challenges. We envisage that it may take many years for our vision to be realized. In the medium term, the need is to integrate IT-enabled assessments where appropriate alongside more traditional methods including teacher assessment.},

Building on our previous patient-safety critical translational research work on drug dosage calculation-competence modelling, and safeMedicate{\textregistered} virtual learning and diagnostic assessment environment design, we introduce three new concepts. First, we re-conceptualise the cognitive and physical modalities of a theory-practice gap, created by the traditional organisation of health professional education practice. Second, that simulated clinical environments occupy the liminal spaces between the ordered, symbolic and abstract world of the classroom, and the situated, messy world of clinical healthcare practice. Third, technology-enhanced boundary objects (TEBOs) function as simulation pedagogy modalities that (a) support students' transition across the liminal space and boundaries between classroom and practice setting, and (b) support competence development and integration in nursing. We use a constructivist-based clinical simulation education model as a guiding pedagogical framework for applying TEBOs and an integrated nursing competence model. The e-version of the paper has embedded animation and illustrative video content to demonstrate these constructivist principles, using technology and computer animation to make complex education ideas accessible to experienced educators and clinicians, early-stage educators, and nursing and healthcare students.},

  abstract = {Instructor evaluations are influenced by implicit age and gender bias, with lower ratings and negative feedback given to instructors believed to stray from stereotypical age and gender norms. Female instructors exhibiting typically male-associated qualities such as leadership and authority, are often negatively impacted. Implicit bias also influences evaluation of digital resources and instructors, regardless of students' positive learning outcomes. As digital learning resources become the norm in education, it is crucial to explore the impact of implicit bias at various educational levels. In this study, undergraduate and graduate students were randomly exposed to one of five digital tutorials; four experimental tutorials presenting identical anatomy content with narrators of different gender and age, and a control tutorial featuring origami (paper folding) instructions without audio. Learning outcomes were measured by pre-quiz vs. post-quiz comparisons using repeated measures MANOVA. Implicit bias was analyzed by evaluation response comparisons using repeated measures MANOVA and three-way MANOVA. Post-quiz scores increased significantly in the four experimental groups (P {$<$} 0.05) but not in the control (P = 0.99). The increased performance was not statistically different across the four experimental groups (P {$>$} 0.26), suggesting that learning occurred irrespective of the instructor gender and age. Students' evaluations were consistently higher for the experimental resources than the control. There was no significant difference in evaluations across the four experimental groups but compared to the control, younger male and younger female narrators received significantly higher ratings for approachability, acceptance, inclusivity, and care for student learning. The study highlights important considerations for digital resources development and interpretation of student evaluations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {The need to be able to choose, perform and interpret the results from appropriate statistical tests is ubiquitous in many STEM disciplines and beyond. In this case study, we illustrate a learning and assessment approach that has been used successfully for first year Business School students taking a module on Business Decision Making for Marketing and Events. The objective of the module is to give students a grounding in statistics, including learning to use the SPSS package, and to apply the techniques learnt to a large real-world data set. Due to the large number of students and their diverse abilities the learning and teaching strategy is centred on using formative key skill e-assessments to encourage students to self-learn. On accessing each e-assessment, students are presented with a randomly generated data set, which they are required to import into SPSS to then appropriately analyse and report on. Marking and feedback occurs automatically on submission and repeated use ensures that a student thoroughly learns a key skill and covers various analysis outcome scenarios, for instance significant or not significant test outcomes. Each key skill e-assessment has multiple embedded links to comprehensive Help pages that provide SPSS 'how-to' information or output interpretation. Access to these means that staff in the PC sessions can concentrate on giving higher-level support as opposed to merely helping with the mechanics of producing SPSS output. The e-assessments were created using Dewis, which is a fully algorithmic open-source e-assessment system. Dewis' ability to communicate with the R programming language facilitates the creation of authentic e-assessments, generating bespoke student data and providing answers that match SPSS screen output. The assessment of students' statistical competency is by in-class e-exams, which are summative and sat under exam conditions. The fact that the formative and summative e-assessments are marked immediately by Dewis represents a huge saving in marking time compared to human marking and allows students to have instant feedback on their work. Repeated use of the formative e-assessments allows students to independently practice and check their understanding. In this case study, we find that those students that did practice achieved significantly higher marks in the e-exams. We are now in our third year of delivery and the module has developed further due to stronger connections between the business and statistics strands of the module.},

  abstract = {The EU-funded TeSLA project -- Adaptive Trust-based e-Assessment System for Learning (http://tesla-project.eu) -- has developed a suite of instruments for e-Authentication. These include face recognition, voice recognition, keystroke dynamics, forensic analysis and plagiarism detection, which were designed for integration within a university's virtual learning environment. These tools were trialed across the seven partner institutions: 4,058 participating students, including 330 students with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND); and 54 teaching staff. This paper describes the findings of this large-scale study where over 50\% of the students gave a positive response to the use of these tools. In addition, over 70\% agreed that these tools were "to ensure that my examination results are trusted" and "to prove that my essay is my own original work". Teaching staff also reported positive experiences with TeSLA: the figure reaching 100\% in one institution. We show there is evidence that a suite of e-authentication tools such as TeSLA can potentially be acceptable to students and staff and be used to increase trust in online assessment. Also, that while not yet perfected for SEND students it can still enrich their experience of assessment. We find that care is needed when introducing such technologies to ensure building the layers of trust required for their successful adoption.},

Challenging the basic premises upon which Prensky constructed his typology, Visitors and Residents fulfil a similar purpose in mapping individuals\&rsquo; engagement with the Web. We argue that the metaphors of \&lsquo;place\&rsquo; and \&lsquo;tool\&rsquo; most appropriately represent the use of technology in contemporary society, especially given the advent of social media. The Visitors and Residents continuum accounts for people behaving in different ways when using technology, depending on their motivation and context, without categorising them according to age or background. A wider and more accurate representation of online behaviour is therefore established.},

  author = {Whitmell, Theresa Elizabeth},
  year = {2020},
  abstract = {The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences of Ontario secondary school teachers, navigating conceptual, pedagogical, cultural and political challenges as they shifted their practice from marks to "gradeless". Twenty-eight teachers from fifteen schools in seven school districts in the province of Ontario in Canada participated in semi-structured, face-to-face interviews. The 28 teachers in this study shared complex journeys of growth and innovation, providing feedback and supporting student learning through use of clear goals, and explicit communication of success criteria. The study provides models of gradeless classroom assessment that range from hidden or deferred marks to four-level rubrics to single-point rubrics to rich descriptive feedback, and from task criteria to curriculum expectations to overarching learning goals. The interviewees described concepts of assessment that centre on the learner, and pedagogical approaches that support student voice and choice. They experienced challenges from the cultural expectations of students, parents and colleagues, but none of the interviewees were restricted by policy requirements from making the changes in assessment practice that they identified as "gradeless", and which serve to support the learning of their students. This study suggests that teachers' conceptual understanding begins with their personal experiences of assessment, is developed through the pedagogy they employ, the cultural influences on their professional and school community, and the policy that underpins their practice. The study demonstrates that when teachers discover processes that improve the achievement of their students, they will persist with the new process even if faced with strong cultural pressure. It suggests that greater communication to, and education of, the school community, parents and students is needed to shift cultural expectations of assessment. The study reveals that given clear policy, grounded in research, teachers can develop stronger conceptual understanding of assessment, and are empowered to move forward, even in the face of strong cultural pressures. Implications for future research in classroom assessment, teacher change, and 21st century learning are further discussed.},

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate a structural model of core of self-assessment, self-efficacy, grit tendencies, academic resilience, and academic demotivation among EFL students. Consequently, 385 EFL students took surveys measuring their language-learning endeavors using the Core of Self-assessment Questionnaire (CSAQ), the Self-Efficacy Scale (S-ES), the language-domain-specific grit scale (L2-Grit S), the Academic Resilience Scale (ARS), and the Academic Demotivation Scale (ADS). Structural equation modeling (SEM) findings revealed that highly resilient and motivated EFL students had high core of self-assessment. Additionally, grit tendencies and self-efficacy displayed effectiveness in elevating academic resilience and motivation in online assessment. The results of this study may have worthwhile pedagogical implications for incorporating technologically enhanced learning and assessment into the classroom.},

In recent years, its use has also become associated with Open Educational Resources (OER). The wide range of competing definitions of open pedagogy, together with its semantic overlap with another underspecified term, open educational practices, makes it difficult to conduct research on the topic of open pedagogy. In making this claim we do not mean to cast doubt on the potential effectiveness of the many pedagogical approaches labeled open. In this article, rather than attempting to argue for a canonical definition of open pedagogy, we propose a new term, ``OER-enabled pedagogy,'' defined as the set of teaching and learning practices that are only possible or practical in the context of the 5R permissions that are characteristic of OER. We propose criteria used to evaluate whether a form of teaching constitutes OER-enabled pedagogy and analyze several examples of OER-enabled pedagogy with these criteria.},

This was initially achieved through audio recordings, then video lectures, supported by a range of digital learning resources intended to engage, support and enhance student learning and the student experience. Descriptive analysis of learning analytics, comprising assessment results, student evaluations of learning and teaching, and data sourced from the Learning Management System, was performed to evaluate the impact of online delivery of course content on student performance, satisfaction and engagement. The use of audio lecture recordings negatively impacted students' perception of the overall quality of the course (including course organisation, learning strategies and learning resources). The subsequent implementation of e-learning designed video lectures was considered superior to audio recordings, albeit final grades were not significantly different between the delivery modes. However, student engagement was equal to, or better than face-to-face delivery, when content was designed specifically for an e-learning environment.},

  abstract = {Assessment in higher education has focused on the performance of individual students. This focus has been a practical as well as an epistemic one: methods of assessment are constrained by the technology of the day, and in the past they required the completion by individuals under controlled conditions of set-piece academic exercises. Recent advances in learning analytics, drawing upon vast sets of digitally stored student activity data, open new practical and epistemic possibilities for assessment, and carry the potential to transform higher education. It is becoming practicable to assess the individual and collective performance of team members working on complex projects that closely simulate the professional contexts that graduates will encounter. In addition to academic knowledge, this authentic assessment can include a diverse range of personal qualities and dispositions that are key to the computer-supported cooperative working of professionals in the knowledge economy. This paper explores the implications of such opportunities for the purpose and practices of assessment in higher education, as universities adapt their institutional missions to address twenty-first century needs. The paper concludes with a strong recommendation for university leaders to deploy analytics to support and evaluate the collaborative learning of students working in realistic contexts.},

  abstract = {How feedback is understood and enacted has shifted from the traditional practice of providing individual feedback on summative tasks at key points to a more ongoing series of dialogues between the teacher and students during the teaching period. This paper reports on the experiences of designing faster feedback through weekly dialogic feedback loops to enhance students' personal connection to their learning while providing teachers with faster, actionable feedback data to inform learning design. A pragmatic inquiry considered how benefits might potentially be amplified through the use of digital technologies. Data included student reflections collected via the GoingOK web application, interviews and focus groups. The findings identify and theorise four types of digitally mediated feedback loops: students in computer-mediated dialogue with themselves; students and teachers in dialogue with each other; the reflection on how feedback informed learning; and the sociotechnical dialogue informing ongoing technical design. Three design dilemmas that were experienced by teachers as they enacted digitally mediated dialogic feedback loops are articulated, alongside the principles that enabled responsive design. Understanding these design elements is fundamental if automation of some parts of the feedback loop through reflective writing analytics is to be considered both feasible and desirable.  Implications for practice or policy:    Digitally mediated feedback loops can facilitate faster feedback, enabling students to reflect on their learning and providing teachers with access to new insights about diverse learners.  Feedback technology can challenge existing ideas about feedback.  Faster feedback can save teachers time, but efficiencies are likely to depend on an increased human workload in the short term as automation technologies can be slower to develop.  Sociotechnical innovation requires collective dialogue between educators and digital developers, across asynchronous timelines.},

Even though educators are familiar with the idea of assessing students, familiarity does not necessarily ensure assessment literacy, or data-based decision making (DBDM) knowledge. Assessment literacy and DBDM are critical in education, and early childhood education in particular, to identify and intervene on potential barriers to students' development. Assessment produces data and evidence educators can use to inform intervention and instructional decisions to improve student outcomes. Given this importance and educators' varying levels of assessment literacy and DBDM knowledge, researchers, and educators should be willing to meet in the middle to support these practices and improve student outcomes. We provide perspective for half of the equation-- how researchers can contribute-- by addressing important considerations for the design and development of assessment measures, implications of these considerations for future measures, and a case example describing the design, and development of an assessment tool created to support DBDM for educators in early childhood education.},

This systematic scoping review found a dearth of literature surrounding policies and guidelines for students. While there appears to be guidance on consent with respect to accessing information or images from vulnerable communities, there is limited guidance on how to address the ethical use of information online. When planning, reviewing, and evaluating guidelines provided for students to develop their personal ePortfolios, ethical use of online information requires careful consideration. Such guidelines will prevent negative impacts on vulnerable communities and improve the quality of work produced by students and their understanding of digital ethics when creating ePortfolios.},

The increase in e-learning use has prompted many institutions to adopt a whole organisation approach to professional development for lecturers. This paper proposes to answer three related questions. How do institutions of vocational education within New Zealand structure their institutional provision of e-learning professional development? What training or other development opportunities are provided by institutions? What do e-learning managers feel are the types of e-learning professional development that work best in terms of lecturer development and support? A literature review was completed and interviews were held with e-learning managers from 13 institutions. The data collected from the interviews were then analysed using a grounded analysis approach. The analysis process yielded concepts that were related to different types of professional development training, information and support. The analysis provided a structure of professional development. Furthermore, the efficiency of the types of e-learning professional development was analysed based on e-learning managers' perception and evaluation models. Professional development with opportunities for skill acquisition and collaboration was deemed the most effective. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic * {$\bullet$} Academic staff need new skills to teach e-learning. * {$\bullet$} There are different levels of professional development, which vary in duration and scope. * {$\bullet$} Professional development needs to be relevant for academic staff to benefit. What this paper adds * {$\bullet$} This paper discusses the types of professional development made available at tertiary institutions for staff new to e-learning. * {$\bullet$} This paper explains what e-learning managers feel is the most effective professional development format. * {$\bullet$} This paper analyses why the e-learning managers feel this format is the most effective. Implications for practice and/or policy * {$\bullet$} Managers will be better informed why particular types of professional development for e-learning work well. * {$\bullet$} Academic staff will be better informed about what professional development might best suit them. * {$\bullet$} Academic staff will be better informed about what managers feel about effective professional development and be able to have a greater role in the evaluation feedback cycle.}

It is a call to NCME members (and others who read this, of course) to rebalance their focus so that classroom assessments are seen as being at least as important as large-scale assessments for education (in fact, in my view, they are more important). The article reviews research literature about the effects of classroom assessment to establish its importance for education. Then, the roles of large-scale assessment are reviewed, and, in particular, it is noted how these can have negative results when the large-scale assessments are not well aligned with sound curriculum and instructional and assessment practices grounded in theories of learning. In the next two sections (a) the idea of a learning progression is described as a way to facilitate the coherence between classroom and large-scale assessment and (b) the idea of a ?roadmap? is described, being the assessment components of the learning progression. This is followed by a description of an example of such a roadmap, developed for the Assessing Data Modeling and Statistical Reasoning project using the BEAR Assessment System (BAS). Finally, a concluding discussion reviews the ways that the coherence between large-scale and classroom assessments can be achieved using the BAS, and hence make measurement more important for education.},

We recount our journey in the project and what we learned about the meaning of tobacco to various First Nations (primarily those in northeastern Turtle Island), about doing research with Indigenous Elders, and about Indigenous research methodology. We reflect on the relationships activated when tobacco is part of a research methodology and share some of the teachings Elders shared with us about research, with a focus on their thoughts about tobacco offerings. It is not this work's intention to prescribe a proper set of steps or a how-to manual for using tobacco in social research.

Portfolio requirements for the appointment or promotion of academic staff recognize that the assessment of teaching practice requires more depth and detail than a candidate's academic CV generally affords. The focus of this study is the electronic teaching portfolios, developed for purposes of promotion, in a vocational higher education context. Data were obtained from candidates' eportfolios, from precourse and end-of-course surveys, as well as from eportfolio assessors' formative and summative feedback. The analysis of the data reveals tensions arising from portfolio building in the particular context of vocational higher education. The nature of the vocational field impacts not only on teaching and learning practice, but on how academic staff choose to present their practice in an eportfolio. The paper argues that the constraints and enablements of context, including the disciplinary context, as well as the possibilities and limitations of agency, will strongly influence the purposes of eportfolio development and the extent to which university teachers can exercise agency in the creation of an eportfolio in a "high stakes" context. The findings can help university appointments and promotions committees, as well as educational developers, to better understand these enablements and constraints in order to inform policy and implementation.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Feedback can be framed as a one-way transmission of information driven by educators, or as a two-way process, in which students' agentic participation is critical to its~success. Despite calls for a shift away from the former framing towards the latter, transmission-focused models of feedback continue to dominate practice internationally. Approaches to feedback in any given setting are likely influenced by the dominant feedback culture. The present study aimed to characterise `feedback cultures' within higher education by systematically examining how feedback is framed in 134 UK universities' (a) educational strategies and (b) Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) Provider statements. These documents serve to encapsulate each institution's views of excellence and best-practice; nevertheless, analysis of the documents revealed a stronger focus on the transmission of feedback comments than on supporting students' learning through feedback processes. Linguistically, students were positioned passively within the documents, as being on the receiving end of teachers' actions, rather than actively driving their own learning through feedback. These findings inform a framework for conceptualising feedback cultures in higher education, which positions approaches to feedback design, feedback processes and the evaluation and development of feedback on a continuum from transmission-focused to learning-focused. It is argued that strategy documents shape practice in subtle ways; in order to shift towards learning-focused feedback cultures, consideration must be given to how students' roles and responsibilities are positioned in both policy and practice.},

In the present study, we sought to gain insight into the extent to which such a shift is evident in practice, and how practice is shaped by national and disciplinary cultures. A total of 688 higher education staff from the UK and Australia completed a survey, in which we collected data pertaining to key influences on the design of feedback, and the extent to which emphasis is placed on student action following feedback. Our respondents reported that formal learning and development opportunities have less influence on feedback practice than informal learning and development, and prior experience. Australian respondents placed greater emphasis on student action following feedback than their counterparts in the UK, and were also more likely than UK respondents to judge the effectiveness of feedback by seeking evidence of its impact on student learning. We contextualise these findings within the context of disciplinary and career stage differences in our data. By demonstrating international differences in the adoption of learning-focused feedback practices, the findings indicate directions for the advancement of feedback research and practice in contemporary higher education.},

  abstract = {Higher education has experienced a significant transformation from traditional face-to-face instruction to online instruction. The purpose of this quantitative causal-comparative study was to determine to what extent postsecondary online faculty utilized brain-based learning techniques as part of their academic practices in the online asynchronous learning environment and to assess differences in the use of these techniques between online full-time and online adjunct faculty employed by two public universities and one private university located in the Southwest region of the United States. The theoretical framework of Hart's (1983) brain-based learning theory (BBLT) informed this study. The sample consisted of 539 accepted and completed surveys. The participants completed 55 questions based on brain-based learning. Quantitative data were collected using Klinek's (2009) questionnaire about brain-based learning knowledge, beliefs, and practices. The data from the questionnaire measured the online faculty's knowledge, beliefs, and practices of brain-based learning techniques. The data were analyzed using descriptive information about the sample computing frequencies of the variables. Cronbach's alpha reliabilities were conducted to complete the descriptive statistics for the first research question. The statistical analysis used for research question two and three was Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) using a 2{\texttimes}2 factorial design to test the hypotheses. The researcher found that there was a significant difference between the BBLT practices of the online faculty from public (M = 3.45) and private universities (M = 3.28), F (1, 294) = 1.62, p = 0.004, [eta]2 = 0.044. The study revealed that there is a lack of knowledge about BBLT supporting the need for professional development and training.},

To conduct classes during COVID-19, the following resources were used: the ELF platform, MS Teams, SketchUp, AutoCAD, email. It was decided to prepare the electronic textbook along with geometric problems to be solved, supplemented by on-line consultations with students. Despite difficulties (technological, psychological), the results obtained by students during the pandemic were very good. Although the average grade during distance learning was higher than in the case of traditional education, students reported a clear need for direct contact with the teacher.},

Conventional higher education institutions are also gradually embracing it across the United States. As online learning surfaces as the new model of contemporary education both in the United States and worldwide, ensuring exam integrity in the online environment is becoming a major challenge to many higher education institutions. To meet this challenge, many of these institutions are outsourcing the examination aspect of their education to online proctoring service providers. The present study, which was conducted on a total of 631 students, assesses the effect of online proctored exams on student test anxiety and exam performance. This study shows that high trait test anxiety results in lower exam scores and that this is especially true for those students with high text anxiety taking exams in an online proctored setting.},

  abstract = {The concept of validity, as described in the literature, has changed over time to become a broad and rather complex issue. The purpose of this paper is to investigate if practice has followed theory, or if there is a gap between validity in theory and validity in practice. It compares the theoretical development of the concept of validity with the methodology adopted in validity studies over time. Important phases in the history of validity, and also common arguments for and against traditional and modern validity perspectives, are presented and discussed. Thereafter, three Swedish research projects aiming to validate instruments used for selection to higher education are described. The idea is to use these projects as examples of contemporary practice, and to compare their designs, research questions and outcomes with how validity was theoretically described during their specific period of time. The conclusions from these comparisons are that practices seem to have followed theory when it comes to how the validity research programmes have been designed, but not when it comes to how they then were carried out in practice. This gap between theory and practice seems to have increased with the introduction of broader and more modern validity perspectives. The scope of the research is more extensive but results are fragmented and there is no evidence of a ?unified? validity argument, which has been one of the central aspects in modern validity theory. This supports the arguments that validity theory is difficult to put into practice and that there is a need for guidance on how to prioritise validity questions and interpret validity evidence.},

To date, researchers have proposed various feedback literacy frameworks, which concern one's ability to interpret and use feedback for their learning, to promote students' feedback engagement by repositioning them as active participants in the learning process. However, the current feedback literacy frameworks have not been adapted to digital or e-Assessment settings despite the increasing use of e-Assessments (e.g., computer-based tests, intelligent tutoring systems) in practice. To address this gap, this conceptual paper introduces a feedback literacy model in the context of e-Assessments to present an intersection between e-Assessment features and the ecological model of feedback literacy for more effective feedback practices in digital learning environments. This paper could serve as a guideline to improve feedback effectiveness and its perceived value in e-Assessment to enhance student feedback literacy.},

From a psychometric perspective, we see a critical need for clarifying the meanings of measurement ``bias'' and ``fairness'' to create common ground for constructive discussions within the field of psychology, higher education, and beyond. We critically evaluate six major sources of information that are widely used to help inform graduate-school admissions decisions: grade point average, personal statements, resumes/curriculum vitae, letters of recommendation, interviews, and GRE. We review empirical research evidence available to date on the validity, bias, and fairness issues associated with each of these admission measures and identify potential issues that have been overlooked in the literature. We conclude by suggesting several directions for practical steps to improve the current admissions decisions and highlighting areas in which future research would be beneficial.},

  abstract = {Despite the importance of feedback uptake in higher education, there is still much to be learned about supporting it. Recent perspectives hold that guiding learners through feedback uptake-oriented activities may also help them to develop feedback literacy. However, due to the acceleration of digitisation trends in higher education, there is an increasing need to explore feedback uptake and literacy development exploiting opportunities offered by digital environments. This need constitutes a significant gap that is of immediate importance to practitioners teaching online and will also be crucial in the post-COVID-19 context in which the use of blended and online learning is only expected to increase. This conceptual article draws on a synthesis of existing feedback uptake, formative assessment and technology literature to offer a technology-mediated dialogic model of feedback uptake and literacy. Focused on how technological mediation can enrich opportunities for co-regulation of the processes involved in feedback uptake, the model is intended for use in designing classroom feedback practices that can be embedded in standard curricula. The model serves to inform the discussion of feedback uptake and the nascent discussion of teacher feedback literacy in the digital settings in which feedback practices in higher education now frequently take place.},

DA is more helpful in fostering students' ability to solve problems independently and in facilitating future tutoring. However, due to its large consumption in time, a vast majority of studies on DA target at a limited scale. To remove this limitation from the implementation of DA, this paper attempts to apply interventionist DA with the support of online scoring systems in EFL writing. Targeting at 44 Chinese L2 English learners, this experimental research mainly adopts quantitative methods with qualitative methods as a supplement to explore their improvement in linguistic accuracy in English writing. It is found that both non-dynamic assessment (NDA) and DA helped participants to improve their accuracy, but only in the DA group observed a remarkable statistical significance. That is, DA is more effective in promoting learning outcomes. Besides, ZPD is predictive for future learning achievement.},

To advance digital and authentic learning in anatomy, a flipped classroom model integrating multimodal digital resources and a multimedia group assignment was designed and implemented for first-year neuroanatomy and third-year regional anatomy curricula. A five-point Likert scale learning and teaching survey was conducted for a total of 145 undergraduate health science students to evaluate students' perception of the flipped classroom model and digital resources. This study revealed that over two-thirds of participants strongly agreed or agreed that the flipped classroom model helped their independent learning and understanding of difficult anatomy concepts. The response showed students consistently enjoyed their experience of using multimodal digital anatomy resources. Both first-year (75\%) and third-year (88\%) students strongly agreed or agreed that digital tools are very valuable and interactive for studying anatomy. Most students strongly agreed or agreed that digital anatomy tools increased their learning experience (similar to 80\%) and confidence ({$>$} 70\%). The third-year students rated the value of digital anatomy tools significantly higher than the first-year students (p = 0.0038). A taxonomy-based assessment strategy revealed that the third-year students, but not the first-year, demonstrated improved performance in assessments relating to clinical application (p = 0.045). In summary, a flipped anatomy classroom integrating multimodal digital approaches exerted positive impact upon learning experience of both junior and senior students, the latter of whom demonstrated improved learning performance. This study extends the pedagogy innovation of flipped classroom teaching, which will advance future anatomy curriculum development, pertinent to post-pandemic education.},

Challenges are identified surrounding how the teachers dealt with (a) inadequate attention to individual students, (b) reduced opportunities for individualised feedback, (c) overwhelming marking responsibilities, and (d) involving students in assessment, with strategies of putting students in groups, matching names with faces, conducting teacher-student conferences, utilising technology to facilitate feedback processes, enabling peer feedback, and transforming students from assessees to assessors. Findings are framed around useful forms of AfL in large classes and the feasibility of AfL in terms of compromises between teacher agency and their temporal and contextual conditions.

Results showed that only the intensity of teacher's follow-up interaction regarding interactive self-reporting had a significant impact on the quality of the assessment data. Specifically, as a behavioural cue elicitor, interactive self-reporting may be best utilised when interaction of a moderate intensity is employed by the teacher following students' self-report. The accuracy and efficiency of interactive self-reporting as a means to obtain assessment data in online teaching can only, thus, be best synergised. Otherwise, the accuracy and efficiency may be reduced to a wax-and-wane relationship, i.e., each one increases at the expense of the other.},

While multiple-choice assessments (compared to other formats such as constructed response) seem to be the preferred method of testing by instructors and students, their effectiveness in assessing comprehension in college courses is sometimes called into question. Research has shown that there are ways to optimize the construction and use of multiple-choice testing to benefit college classroom instruction and assessment, student learning, and performance, and to more efficiently utilize instructor's time and energy. This teacher-ready research review provides an overview of the research on utilizing multiple-choice questions as well as some tips on using, writing, and administering multiple-choice questions during assessments. We also summarize the benefits and potential issues with using multiple-choice questions including concerns about cheating, ways to detect and deter cheating, and testing issues and strategies unique to online formats.

Participants were 163 college students. Students were asked to accomplish a given learning task via an online PA system. Of the participants, 62 were interviewed after the activity. The interviews revealed hierarchically related and qualitatively different categories of conceptions and approaches to learning via online PA. The main and achieved levels of conceptions of and approaches to learning were determined. The results showed that, within each level, conceptions emphasizing a fragmented and cohesive learning tended to be associated with approaches focusing on surface and deep learning, respectively. In addition, students with cohesive learning conceptions and deep learning approaches were likely to make greater progress in the early stages of online PA activity. The present study finally found that approaches to learning via online PA were less related to the learning outcomes than conceptions of learning.

  abstract = {Online tests have been identified as a core learning activity in higher education. Unlike conventional online tests, which cannot completely reflect students' learning status, two-tier tests not only consider students' answers, but also take into account reasons for their answers. Due to such significance, research into the two-tier tests had mushroomed but few studies examined why the two-tier test approach was effective. To this end, we conducted an empirical study, where a lag sequential analysis was used to analyze behavior patterns while qualitative data from the questionnaire were applied to explain why these behavior patterns were happened. The results indicated students with a two-tier test tended to realize the rationale of a concept, instead of relying on their memories. In other words, the two-tier test can facilitate students to develop deep thinking skills. This may be because they considered the two-tier test as a learning tool, instead of an assessment tool only.},

This paper examines how e-portfolios take up these formative roles to support productive learning. Qualitative findings from interviews with selected first-year undergraduate students at a higher education institution in Hong Kong are reported concerning students' experiences of constructing e-portfolios as assessment tasks. As part of an institutional teaching and learning initiative, e-portfolios were incorporated into three core courses for first-year students. The findings reveal that several conditions necessary to foster productive learning were missing in students' experiences: strengthened formative role of e-portfolios through coherent assessment design; encouragement for students' pursuit of authentic tasks to develop learning interests; engagement of students in reflective and self-regulative learning as an essential learning process; provision of constructive feedback for sustained learning support; and support for students' autonomy through facilitation of collaborative knowledge building. By explicating how the lack of these conditions impeded students' active involvement in e-portfolio tasks and suggesting relevant strategies for teachers at the institution in question, this paper offers implications for harnessing information and communication technology (ICT) to support students' productive learning.},

  abstract = {The use of peer assessment has been investigated for decades. However, the results of different studies are mixed. In this study, the implementation of peer assessment was attempted to assess students' reading aloud and oral presentation in two higher diploma/associate degree English language courses in Hong Kong. Students' opinions towards the implementation were obtained from the online questionnaire and follow-up interviews. In the end, 163 students from the two courses completed the questionnaire and 11 of them were involved in the interviews voluntarily. Apart from focusing on students' perceptions of peer assessment, the effects of the use of an online platform for peer assessment were explored. The results showed that more than half of the students were positive towards peer assessment because of their perceived benefits such as consolidating subject knowledge, engaging critical thinking and encouraging active student involvement in the assessment process. Regarding peer feedback, a few participants expressed that they were not confident in their abilities and English levels. Also, the majority of students interviewed commented negatively about the quality of their peers' feedback. Based on the findings, some implications for education and future studies were drawn.},

  abstract = {Many assessments of writing proficiency that aid in making high-stakes decisions consist of several essay tasks evaluated by a combination of human holistic scores and computer-generated scores for essay features such as the rate of grammatical errors per word. Under typical conditions, a summary writing score is provided by a linear combination of the holistic scores and the feature scores. The best linear predictor (BLP) is used to approximate the true composite writing score by a linear combination of holistic scores and scores of essay features. However, because the relationship between computer-generated feature score and human scores may depend on subgroup membership and the same scoring rules must normally be applied to all test takers, Yao, Haberman, and Zhang proposed a modified methodology of the penalized best linear predictor (PBLP) by incorporating a quadratic penalty function into the conventional BLP method. This research report contains full accounts of the BLP results as well as supplementary PBLP results to Yao et al. for three assessments of writing that aid in making high-stakes decisions: the "TOEFL iBT"{\textregistered} Writing test, the "GRE"{\textregistered} General Analytical Writing subject test, and the "Praxis"{\textregistered} Core Academic Skills for Educators: Writing assessment. Results obtained indicate the added value in using machine features for prediction of composite true scores of essay writings and effectiveness of the penalty function in suppressing the lack of population invariance.},

  abstract = {The AI-driven Fourth Industrial Revolution and the COVID-19 pandemic have one important thing in common: they both have caused significant and rapid changes to the skill set landscape of various industries. These disruptive forces mean that the early identification of the newly rising skills in a labour market --- which we call its ``emerging skills'' --- is crucial to its workforce. It is also crucial to the educators who, in order to provide lifelong training to the workforce, need to quickly adapt their curricula to the new skills. We propose a classification methodology that uses the past job ad trends of skills to predict the emerging skills of a future period, defined as the skills that have experienced a surge in hiring demand in said period. This general definition allows for freedom in specifying the criteria for a skill being emerging (through thresholds on hiring demand and its growth), which could be important to educators. Applying our methodology to the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) labour market in Singapore, we show that we are able to predict future emerging skills with good precision and recall and beat two baseline classifiers for multiple threshold sets. Our methodology also allows us to see where job ads fail to provide sufficient predictive signals, pointing to auxiliary data sources (such as Stack Overflow for ICT) and skill ontologies as potential remedies. The success of our method shows how AI can be used to empower learners and educators in the ICT domain (and potentially other domains) with useful and well-curated insights at a moment's notice, thus helping speed up the process of curricular change.},

  abstract = {Conversational agents such as chatbots have recently gained a lot of traction in various industries, including education, marketing, and healthcare. In K--12 and higher education, conversational agents have been used to boost student learning and motivation. Recently, new applications of conversational agents, such as conversation-based assessments, have emerged in the context of educational assessments. Such applications aim to enhance students' assessment experiences through the use of conversational agents in administering items (or tasks) and providing feedback to students. To discuss the utility of conversational agents in assessments, this paper puts a special emphasis on test-taking effort in low-stakes assessments. It provides a brief introduction to educational assessments and student test-taking motivation, presents the concept of conversational agents for learning and assessment along with several examples, examines the benefits and challenges of conversational agents used for learning and assessment purposes, and discusses the concept of conversation-based assessment. This position paper contributes to the literature by discussing the utility of conversation-based assessments as a novel tool to enhance test-taking effort among students and thereby obtain a more accurate representation of students' academic performance. Specifically, we describe the advantages and disadvantages of using conversation-based assessments for addressing the lack of test-taking effort in digital formative assessments and discuss how conversation-based assessments can foster a more engaging testing experience for students.},

Teachers, in many classrooms, provide feedbacks to students are relatively rare. Feedback is most effective in learning when students have the opportunity to use it to readjust their thinking. Technology integration, a part of learner centered classroom, is support to providing feedback in effective way. This paper explores the design of learner centered classroom in relation to the interactive technology integration which is based on using mobile technology to provide effective feedback in learning environment. Higher education students used mobile interactive technology with teacher, one term, in misconception in science course. Qualitative research design was used in this research.

Milton, Pollio and Eison (1986) made a fairly forceful case that grading was suspect, but to little avail -- not surprisingly, since a long-established approach is difficult to dislodge. There is now more evidence that grading does not do what many believe it does (especially in respect of providing trustworthy indexes of student achievement), so the time may be ripe for a further challenge to existing grading practices. Grade is inherently ambiguous as a term, in that it can be used in respect of rawmarks or scores, derivatives of rawmarks (in the US, for example, the letter grades determined by conversion of raw percentages), and overall indexes of achievement. In this chapter the ambiguity is not entirely avoided: however, an appreciation of the context in which the term `grade' is used should mitigate the problem of multiple meaning.

Previous studies have noted remarkable improvement of students' learning through the integration of games in classroom teaching. However, little attention has been given to the integration of games element in language classroom that particularly aims to hone students' writing skills. In response to current language learning situation related to writing skills, this current study sought for a new method of assessment in ESL context. An online game application, Kahoot, was used as the primary tool for students' assessment in an academic writing course participated by 32 ESL students in a public university in Malaysia. Qualitative research design was conducted in this study and collection of data was conducted through focus group discussion with ESL learners and a semi-structured interview with ESL instructors. The Responses from students and instructors were recorded and transcribed in verbatim. Thematic analysis of the data revealed that ESL learners found that game-based assessment is highly engaging despite of some learners' anxiety towards the use of technology. ESL instructors also highlighted the importance of learning objectives in assessing students' performance regardless of the tools used.},

This study investigated the effects of online peer assessment in a General Education course on the development of critical thinking among Hong Kong undergraduates, with a design characterised by six elements (i.e. online peer assessment training, provision of guiding questions, peer feedback requirements, anonymity, student evaluation of the usefulness of peer feedback and summative use of online peer assessment). Analysis of the participants' e-journal entries revealed a significant improvement in critical thinking in the experimental groups. Individual follow-up interviews indicated that the participants acknowledged online peer assessment design with the consideration of cultural influence and at the same time made some suggestions for refinement. This study highlights the need to adopt a culturally embedded approach to design online peer assessment to cultivate students' critical thinking in non-western contexts.

A total of 37 empirical studies published from 1999 to 2018 were selected and analysed. Results indicated that technology-facilitated peer assessment had a significant and medium effect on learning achievements with an overall mean effect size of 0.576. The use of extra supporting strategies in technology-facilitated peer assessment also produced a positive and medium effect on students' learning achievements with an overall mean effect size of 0.543. Different moderator variables, such as task types, assessment modes, training for assessors, durations, grouping types and assessment methods were related to different effect sizes. The results together with the implications for both practice and research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Although formative assessment has been recognized as an effective way for improving learning, scant attention has been paid to the specific design on the sequence of applying formative assessment practice in computer-assisted language learning (CALL). Even less emphasis has been devoted to the cognitive and affective outcomes of different orders of formative assessment strategies on building students' public speaking competence. This mixed-method research employed multi-source data to explore and explain the effects of two different ways of sequencing video-based formative assessment on English language learners' public speaking anxiety and their performance. Two intact classes in a 16-week English public speaking course were randomly assigned to two groups, 25 in the self-assessment-initiated (SAI) group and 26 in the peer-assessment-initiated (PAI) group. Following two different sequences of formative practice, both groups were required to complete three formal English public speeches. Both quantitative and qualitative findings indicated that learners in the SAI group showed significantly lower public speaking anxiety than those in the PAI group, whereas learners in the PAI group showed significantly better public speaking performance. Moreover, the findings showed that SAI formative practice helped the learners to pay more attention to their delivery and anxiety levels in public speaking, while PAI formative practice may have led the learners to improve their proper use of English language. This research indicated that the sequence of implementing different modalities of assessment matters. Supported by video technology and CALL tools, different sequences in obtaining varying sources of feedback can affect students' public speaking anxiety and competence. This study provides refined understandings about the sequences of using video technology in formative practice for alleviating the learners' public speaking anxiety and improving their performance. The findings suggest that self-assessment should be arranged first for learners with a higher-level of anxiety while peer-assessment should be conducted first for learners with a lower-level of English language proficiency.

This study systematically reviewed 134 technology-supported peer assessment studies published between 2006 and 2017 using a developed analysis framework based on activity theory. The results found that most peer assessment activities were implemented in social science and higher education in the past 12 years. Acting assignments such as performance, oral presentations, or speaking were the least common type of assignments assessed across the studies reviewed. In addition, most studies conducted peer assessment anonymously and assessors and assessees were randomly assigned. However, most studies implemented only one round of peer assessment and did not provide rewards for assessors. Across studies, it was more often the case that students received unstructured feedback from their peers than structured feedback. Noticeably, collaborative peer assessment did not receive enough attention in the past 12 years. Regarding the peer assessment tools, there were more studies that adopted general learning management systems for peer assessment than studies that used dedicated peer assessment tools. However, most tools used within these studies only provide basic functionalities without scaffolding. Furthermore, the results of cross analysis reveal that there are significant relationships between learning domains and anonymity as well as learning domains and assessment durations. Significant relationships also exist between assignment types and learning domains as well as assignment types and assessment durations.},

This research explores differences and similarities in the perception of digital technology by lecturers and academic managers. The purpose of this paper is to compare and contrast motivations, barriers and support systems required for the use and adoption of digital strategies. Interviews were conducted with a group of 20 lecturers and academic managers in the HE sector. The results reveal that both groups shared a common view that the introduction of digital technology can have a clear set of benefits to students; however, their motivations for introducing new approaches differed significantly. Whilst it is important not to generalise too much given the lack of homogeneity in the two groups and also the crossover between managers and lecturers, managers tended to take a performance goal-based approach to its introduction whilst lecturers were more learning goal orientated. This difference can cause significant difficulties in the implementation of new approaches to learning.},

The results show that diverse strategies were used to facilitate group collaboration, including group agreements, project planning, role assignments, problem-based projects, and instructor feedback. The reviewed studies primarily evaluated learners through instructor evaluation, peer evaluation, and self-evaluation methods. The most common strategy was instructor assessment, while self-evaluations were used the least.

  abstract = {Traditional methods of student assessment (SA) include self-reported surveys, standardized tests, etc. These methods are widely regarded by researchers as inducing test anxiety. They also ignore students' thinking processes and are not applicable to the assessment of higher-order skills. Digital game-based assessment (DGBA) is thought to address the shortcomings of traditional assessment methods. Given the advantages of DGBA, an increasing number of empirical studies are working to apply digital games for SA. However, there is a lack of any systematic review of DGBA studies. In particular, very little is known about the characteristics of the games, the content of the assessment, the methods of implementation, and the distribution of the results. This study examined the characteristics of DGBA studies, and the adopted games on SA in the past decade from different perspectives. A rigorous systematic review process was adopted in this study. First, the Web of Science (WOS) database was used to search the literature on DGBA published over the last decade. Then, 50 studies on SA were selected for subsequent analysis according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results of this study found that DGBA has attracted the attention of researchers around the world. The participants of the DGBA studies were distributed across different educational levels, but the number of participants was small. Among all game genres, educational games were the most frequently used. Disciplinary knowledge is the most popular SA research content. Formative assessment modeling with process data and summative assessment using final scores were the most popular assessment methods. Correlation analysis was the most popular analysis method to verify the effectiveness of games on SA. However, many DGBA studies have reported unsatisfactory data analysis results. For the above findings, this study further discussed the reasons, as well as the meanings. In conclusion, this review showed the current status and gaps of DGBA in the SA application; directional references for future research of researchers and game designers are also provided.},

This student-centered approach provided value for the instructor seeking to improve the learning environment and content in real-time, and for the students who actively participated in the process of course improvement. Three types of assessment were used in this course: online formative course feedback every three weeks; weekly 'muddiest point' content feedback; and midterm exam scores. Data were assessed using a mixed-methods approach. The formative feedback from this course provided information on how students perceived the flipped classroom and how those perceptions changed across the semester. This approach provided a low-effort strategy for incorporating the student voice for teaching and learning improvement. Although the intended assessment outcome was real-time improvement of the course, an unintended outcome of incorporating student voices and reflection during the course process was realized. Student acceptance of the flipped class increased as the semester progressed, and they placed high value on in-class active learning, the ability to re-visit the online lectures, and having a professor who valued their feedback and suggestions for course improvement. The majority of students also faced time management challenges that extended beyond this specific class.},

  abstract = {Contemporary schools have not changed significantly since the 19th century. From primary level (elementary schools) to tertiary level of education (colleges and universities), the predominant approach to teaching is ex-cathedra teaching with assessment system based on grades. What has changed over the years are teaching and learning tools, but the methods have remained the same. In this context, information and communication technology is viewed as a tool supporting the traditional education systems. The new, hyper-digital era is based on ubiquitous computing that is radically transforming the way we live and work, and consequently, the way we teach and learn. Contemporary technologies lead to disruptive innovations in all sectors. As such, traditional education system fails to perceive the necessity to rethink the fundamental paradigms of education based on institutional framework (schools). This paper examines the evolution of education in the context of information and communication technologies and analyses the strengths and weaknesses of traditional, school-based education, as opposed to ubiquitous education based on information and communication technology, which has not been formally acknowledged within education systems, but which depends on effort invested by individuals instead. It also examines disruptive innovations in education systems that have a potential to transform formal education processes dramatically.},

The institutionalizing practices and operational assumptions of Google Inc. are the primary lens for this analysis as they are rendered in two recent articles authored by Google Chief Economist Hal Varian. Varian asserts four uses that follow from computer-mediated transactions: `data extraction and analysis,' `new contractual forms due to better monitoring,' `personalization and customization,' and `continuous experiments.' An examination of the nature and consequences of these uses sheds light on the implicit logic of surveillance capitalism and the global architecture of computer mediation upon which it depends. This architecture produces a distributed and largely uncontested new expression of power that I christen: `Big Other.' It is constituted by unexpected and often illegible mechanisms of extraction, commodification, and control that effectively exile persons from their own behavior while producing new markets of behavioral prediction and modification. Surveillance capitalism challenges democratic norms and departs in key ways from the centuries-long evolution of market capitalism.},
